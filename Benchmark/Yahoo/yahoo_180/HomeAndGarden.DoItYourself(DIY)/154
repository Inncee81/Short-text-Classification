how do i keep my desk chair from squeaking when rocking i got a really nice leather office chair for my house but within a few weeks it started squeaking when rocking this has happened to me with all my other desk chairs with the rocking function the squeak seems to be coming from the spring that allows the chair to rock the one you tighten or loosen depending on how you like it but the spring is entirely covered by the plastic knob used to tighten it since it's covered i can't really get to it with wd even when using that straw thing it comes with i'm not overloading the chair since i only weigh lbs so i'm not quite sure what to do about the squeak any suggestions if you back the plastic knob out all the way to the point it comes off you can use the straw and give it a couple squirts or you can remove the four bolts in the base of the chair and seat frame remove the seat and back as one unit the spring will be completely open to viewing and you can squirt it then Sears Holdings Corporation Lawn mower Briggs & Stratton Mower Lawn The Lawnmower Man Mower County, Minnesota Amazon.com Combine harvester Chatsworth House Street Continuously variable transmission McMansion Automatic transmission Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) Harmony, Minnesota Plastic flamingo Tractor The Straight Story Bowls Arcola, Illinois Irrigation Nucor Corporation Steam engine Autonomous robot Tennis Australian War Memorial Cerritos, California Transmission (mechanics) Franglais Oak Lawn, Illinois International Harvester Motor oil Universal Studios Gardening Deere & Company Africanized bee Central Park Wilton House Laserdisc Wimbledon, London Iranian architecture Lawn sign Lahore Lawn ornament Dallas, Texas San Marino, California Ownership Kolkata Crop circle Newburgh (city), New York Live 8 Larry Walters Richmond, Indiana Finglish Auction Brooklyn Intellivision Campbell, California Playboy (magazine) Juventud Guerrera Fair Lawn, New Jersey Guess Who's Coming to Criticize Dinner?
