what do you use to cover a textured wall i have walls that have several layers of paint and paper on them so they look rough and textured i do not want to remove all of that so i want to know what i can use to cover a wall and texture it you can do as sensible man said and paint it with texture pain but my advice would be to strip it down because sooner or later as you add layers of paint it will all just fall off and if as you say there are lots of layers of paint and wall paper on there you chances are pretty high that it could get messy while you try paint it this time so best option is to strip the walls and do them properly Epoxy Reinforced concrete Varnish Plastic Paint Deck (ship) Resin Casting Lacquer Guinea pig Sharpie (marker) Bong Terrazzo Animal Crossing Manicure Adhesive Carbon fiber Rachel Whiteread Fiberglass Petrochemical Friction Abercrombie & Fitch Co.
