how do i make a walkway over existing concrete with small stone and epoxy what kind of epoxy is needed at a state park in ohio the shower rooms floor was covered with stone i called the people that put it in they used epoxy and small smoothe stones they said they put it over existing concrete makes a beautiful finish i want to do a 'x ' pad leading to my flower garden and i want to do it myself any one out there with experience that can tell me how the nearest company would have to travel miles to come do that small of an area pretty costy please help i have done something similar to this with broken ceramic tile i did not use epoxy but rather used a ceramic tile adhesive that works outdoors i spread the adhesive placed the odd shaped broken tile randomly let dry and spread tile grout over the pieces filling in the spaces between the tile and wiping off the top of the pieces then i sealed it with water seal i'm not sure how deep you'll need the epoxy to embed the stones so it may be quite expensive also of you don't like it or want to change it later epoxy is usually very difficult to remove there are so many patterns and colors of tile and if you talk to a tile store manager about the broken pieces they find everyday you may get the tile free if not you only have to buy pieces to cover x if you did it solid using ' tile to figure so you would need pieces to break up tile grout comes in dozens of colors good luck with it whatever you do Screw Drill bit Basement Seismic retrofit Rail tracks Clinker (boat building) Carpet Concrete Gymnastics Nail (engineering) Sundial Stairway Reinforced concrete Drill Plasticizer Anchor Boat building Shoe Prestressed concrete San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Mid-levels Roomba Chair Tile Upholstery Dial M for Murder Violin Drill bit sizes Electrical wiring Professional wrestling match types Pile Vacuum cleaner Screwdriver Straw-bale construction Drywall Drill bit shank Panama Canal Locks Bolted joint Connection Diving regulator Tire Symmetry Budapest Metro Palace of Westminster Punch (engineering) Lebesgue covering dimension RMS Titanic Screw thread Combine (Half-Life 2) Surface-mount technology Geodesic dome Hyatt Regency walkway collapse George Clooney Oil platform Timber framing Adhesive Sonic the Hedgehog 2 Rebar Terrazzo P__voa de Varzim Genericized trademark Stapler Scuba set Bar (establishment) Animal Crossing Magical objects in Harry Potter Collapse of the World Trade Center The Hoover Company Olympic Stadium, Berlin Woodworking Gender Light-frame construction Kilmarnock, Scotland Doom engine Futon Glossary of climbing terms Overhead powerline Tractor Vise (tool) Hydraulic machinery Air-raid shelter Worms weapons and tools Tower 42 Jetty Propeller Shawn Daivari Pforzheimer House Fuselage Cello Printed circuit board Home improvement Lighting 24 Hours of Le Mans Roger Federer Bobbio Orosius Diving cylinder Colditz Castle Glasgow Green Incandescent light bulb Elevator
