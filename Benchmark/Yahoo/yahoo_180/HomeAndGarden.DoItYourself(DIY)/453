does a water filter go bad if it isn't used for a couple of weeks especially when it had water still in it i just moved and couldn't hook up my water filter to the new house's faucet because i didn't have the right adapter i have now bought the adapter and hooked it up i'm just wondering since i didn't flush it prior to moving it's had water sitting in the chamber for a couple of weeks would that water sitting over the charcoal and stuff int he filter cause it to go bad or even begin to spread bacteria i think you are fine the filter is designed to clean the water and i doubt that bacteria would grow very well in there i would just hook it up and let the water run for a few minutes to flush it out it is no different than going on vacation for a couple of weeks the water sits inside just a guess but i think you are very safe Drill bit Seismic retrofit Roof Sento Changeroom Ra (board game) Plumbing fixture Tessellation Dishwasher Dymaxion house Basement STS-114 Equine conformation Spark plug Dundas Square McMansion Tile Domestic water system Flush toilet Wildfire STS-61 Mosaic St Albans Cathedral Stairway Mattress The Sims 2 Passenger car Asbestos De Lorean DMC-12 Table saw Glossary of firefighting equipment Car body style King Khalid International Airport E85 Space Shuttle program Japanese toilet Combine (Half-Life 2) Chevrolet Corvair Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Carcassonne (board game) Inflation Window Architecture of the California missions Toyota Camry Autonomous building Customs and etiquette of Japan Oxy-fuel welding and cutting Supply and demand Dominoes P-61 Black Widow Tesla coil Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Textile manufacturing Keynesian economics Fire fighting Bristol Grammar School Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine Fountain Table tennis Siphon Internal ballistics Wood carving Queensbridge Wallpaper group Swimming pool Combine harvester Toilet Autostereogram Glossary of climbing terms Water purification Mahjong Toilet paper Microeconomics Metro station View camera Columbine High School massacre Home repair Super Nintendo Entertainment System Radio controlled airplane Upholstery Car safety Rapid transit Trapping Eggerland series Prisons in the United States Dodge Neon Floppy disk London Underground Spyware Automobile Baseball Revolving door Refrigerator HM Prison Pentridge Gameking The Doors Station wagon Menstrual cup
