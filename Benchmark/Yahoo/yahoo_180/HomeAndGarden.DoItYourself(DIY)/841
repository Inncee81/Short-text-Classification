why is hot water presure low after refitting bathroom i am currently in the process of refitting my bathroom i turned the water off at the tank and replaced all the pipework then turned the water back on and tested it and was fine i turned the water off again while i fitted the rest of the bathroom a week later i had installed the bath and taps so i turned the water back on cold water is fine but hot water has very low pressure basin and kitchen sink also have same problem is it possible the tank needs to refill before i get decent pressure back why else might pressure be so low sounds like there is an airlock in the hot water system i'm assuming you have a system with hot and cold water storage cylinders if you don't then don't try this try connecting the hot and cold taps together with a short length of hose and suitable connectors turn on the hot tap first then slowly turn on the cold tap for no more than seconds turn both taps off cold first and then try it if there has been an airlock the pressure of the cold water should have cleared it and the hot should run normally Parade (military) Drilling and threading Drill Drill bit shank Lock picking Destiny of the Daleks Key (lock) Marching band Drill bit M1 Garand Safe-cracking Shotgun Internal ballistics Eskrima Locked room mystery Climbing equipment Tubular pin tumbler lock Pneumatics Chuck (engineering) Radar Manual transmission Ingersoll-Rand Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Printed circuit board Barbara Boxer Panama Canal Gun safety Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Wing Chun Sento WNNX (FM) Pin tumbler lock Pok__mon Abilities Panama Canal Locks Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Welland Canal Gatling gun __tienne Bonnot de Condillac Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake Inferno (Doctor Who) Characters of Lost G-Man (Half-Life) M16 (rifle) Machine tool Edwin Drake The Shining (film) Fire alarm control panel Eagle Claw Attack on Pearl Harbor Traveling salesman problem Drilling rig Flintlock Coming of Age (TNG episode) Changeroom Doctor Who (Enemy Within) Glossary of climbing terms M4 Carbine Oil well USS Atule (SS-403) Bradley International Airport Space colonization Who Shot Mr. Burns?
