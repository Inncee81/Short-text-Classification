how much tar is in camel lights i'm trying to convince my boyfriend the tar and nicotine in a light cigarette is the same as in a regular camel if you look at the filter you will see a series of holes that are poked in in a very specific pattern those holes are designed to take in clean air thru the filter so that when a test is ran on the random cigarette by a testing lab it will pull in more air and less of the bad stuff and the secret is that the testing companies use a device similar to a straw on the end of the filter for the test but those little holes are placed in the filter in just the right place by the company so that when you are smoking a light cigarette you have your fingers covering those holes and well imagine that you got all the tar and nicotine you would have gotten from the regular version anyway if you look at the filter of a light cigarette versus the filter of a regular one after they are smoked you might notice that the light one has a bit more clean spaces around the outer edge thats from not getting all the holes covered every time you inhale but non the less you still got what the tobacco company is counting on your temporary dose of poisons that are in every lit cigarette now that i finished this little novelette i think i will go out on the patio and fire up my cigarette and no its not a light Paint Woodworking Varnish Pottery Casting Primer (paint) Brazing Wood finishing Brush Glaze Wood Lacquer Drill bit Handloading Knife Upholstery Sandpaper Internal ballistics Brewery Tempera Mattress Epoxy Amateur telescope making Friction Plastic Violin Manicure Painter and decorator Table tennis Stucco Hand grenade Painting Aluminium Textile manufacturing Impressionism Titanium Masonry Wok Polyurethane Nunchaku Gesso Galvanization Hamster Christmas tree Cartridge (firearms) Wood carving Printed circuit board Gas metal arc welding Volleyball Photographic film Light-emitting diode Airsoft Powder metallurgy Bassoon Leather Technicolor Carpet Drawing Transformer Solar cell Diamond enhancement Polymerase chain reaction Gilding Architecture of the California missions Fire extinguisher Boat building Glass Fluoride therapy Dinghy Fire fighting Pavement (material) Sand casting Textile manufacturing terminology Lead paint Wassily Kandinsky Repouss__ and chasing Cosmic Era technology Billiards Corrosion Watercolor painting Arcade cabinet Explosive material Surrealist techniques Collecting fossils Color Professional wrestling match types Trail blazing Seismic retrofit Paper marbling Piet Mondrian Air pollution Panel painting Welding Clinker (boat building) Cigar Tin Compact disc Jan van Goyen Acrylic paint
