insect repellant recipe anyone i would like to make an insect repellant recipe for us to use while gardening i am thinking a simple oil or salve can anyone help i have neem citronella lavender rosemary and a few other essential oils carrier oils on hand that need to be used would love some tried true advice before i start blending thank you i think essential oils in a base of white clay are best used as an insect repellent during the summer heat outside in the dirt and the humidity covered in oil can be a bummer citronella and eucalyptus citriodora are effective bay laurel litsea cubeba and terebinth are good too you can use hydrosols as well they will feel great outside in the heat they are inexpensive and you can add some essential oils to make them more repellent you should keep in mind that you don't really want to treat yourself with these essential oils you aren't going for any transdermal absorption here you want them to remain on the skin and act as a barrier Solar power Fire Kitchen Stove Titanium Grill Hydrogen economy Heat sink Heat Nuclear explosion Ionizing radiation Plastic Heinkel He 100 Solar panel Planetary nebula Charles Goodyear Radium Incandescent light bulb Portable stove Uranium Solar variation Circuit design Cookware and bakeware Diode Engine cooling Light Nuclear power Epoxy Pebble bed reactor Gravitational radiation Sunlight Renewable energy Black body Radioisotope thermoelectric generator Linear particle accelerator Barbecue Infrared Milk Nuclear fallout Criticality accident Nuclear fission Thermoregulation Sun MS-06 Zaku II Synthetic diamond Sewage treatment MRE Planetary habitability Energy Volcano Quantum Infrared homing Biofuel Solar collector Cosmic microwave background radiation Future energy development Nuclear weapon design Dairy Gliding Watercooling Vulcanization Inertial confinement fusion Zinc Air conditioning HVAC Microwave oven Technetium Radiator Horseshoe Heat exchanger Ko__ Holding Franklin stove Stirling engine Overclocking Radiation implosion Nuclear fusion Mercury (element) Silver Extrasolar planet X-ray tube Fusion power Supercharger Casting Domain Name System Upholstery Boiler Hyperinflation Printed circuit board Galileo spacecraft Artemisia Gentileschi Wok Loudspeaker Soldering Ozone layer Tsar Bomba CD-R Effective radiated power Electromagnetic radiation Autonomous building Radioactive contamination
