when i flush my toilet i have to hold down the handle to make it flush all the way and then the water only fills the bottom on the bowl what is causing this like many have said the chain from the handle to the flapper is probably too long shorten it the other possiblitly is the flappers design or condition the flapper stops the water in the tank from draining into the bowl until the pull chain lifts it out of the seat when pulled up the flapper kind of looks like an upside down cup with air trapped in the cup part it is this air that keeps the flapper up floating until enough water has left the tank to make the flapper fall again some flappers in poor attempts to save water are made with a small hole in the cup part that allows air to escape and therefore the flapper falls earlier allowing less water to to exit the tank if this is the case buy a new flapper that does not have this little hole in the cup part i have done this many times and it has worked every time even without a manufactured hole if the rubber of the flapper is breaking down there may be many small crack that the air is escaping through if your hands are covered in black debris from handling the flapper you may want to replace it with a design that does not have a hole hope this helps Professional wrestling holds Ed, Edd n Eddy Counterfeit Professional wrestling match types Plastic bag Textile manufacturing Confidence trick Climbing equipment Professional wrestling Jackass: The Movie Krag-J__rgensen Pin oak Poker jargon Autograph Hazing Automatic teller machine Punk rock Cartridge (firearms) The Marriage of Figaro Professional wrestling slang Shackle Comanche Steering Hat BS 1363 Bookbinding Haircut Universal Serial Bus Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Roller chain Professional wrestling throws EastEnders Reamer Ocean's Twelve Professional wrestling aerial techniques Wood United States dollar Christmas tree WWE Unforgiven Pachypodium key to species Gay slang TIA-568A/B Texas hold 'em Hand grenade The Daily Show Mark Calaway Parachute Semi-automatic self-loading pistol Necktie Frogman Katelyn Faber Fractal Repeating rifle Firearm Elections in the United States Glossary of American football Clothing Pine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Star Wars Holiday Special Jean Charles de Menezes The Big Lebowski Judo Gresham's law GunZ The Duel Upholstery Textile manufacturing terminology Glossary of climbing terms Pin (device) Drag racing Animaniacs Jeopardy!
