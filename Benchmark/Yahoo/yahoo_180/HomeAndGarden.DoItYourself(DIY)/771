is tensioning necessary for field fencing with t posts i want to put up fencing to keep neighbor dogs and coyotes off my property but know little about it i won't be keeping animals inside just protecting my cats and garden from predators i bought ' high woven wire field fencing and six foot t posts my land is hilly and the fence will be climbing up and down its entire length it is soft dirt in spots hard clay in others with no rocks anywhere i've seen some places say wooden corner braces are unnecessary that you can make braces from t posts using the right widgets i'm interested in that because you wouldn't have to dig post holes however no site describes how to tension this sort of t post only field fence let's say i did install wooden corner braces and try to tension the fence how could i tension that with the land being as uneven as it is is tensioning even necesary in this situation maybe just rounding the corners would work after miles of fence i have a suggestion or two your corner posts should likely be a bit more substantial even using chain link fence corners tension in your type can be accomplished with help and not strictly as tight as chain link though some of the critters you describe might either climb or dig if you are able and have the option you might walk the line and determine the corners then best determine the support mechanism ie anchor wires angled away from each corner concrete poured into the cornet post holes etc with chain link when i do it alone i use a come along in multiples and wire bracket the fence section at each post as i move along in your case you probably can do the same even just with one other person pulling to provide the needed tension don't use wood at the corners if the tension preceding has been accomplished do the same and yes wrap if possible to keep from having to cut and start again again the greater issue might be at ground level and access through under by any critters steven wolf Dishwasher Dishwashing Menstrual cup Detergent Japanese toilet Dry cleaning Car washing techniques Laundry detergent Toilet paper Urinal Vinegar Sento Sodium hypochlorite Kitchen Soap Wheat Washing machine Manicure Priestly Code Toilet Bathroom Trisodium phosphate E-6 process Brush Vacuum cleaner Tessellation Brewery Water purification Dundas Square 1,4-dichlorobenzene Disinfection Contact lens Halitosis Blood Simple Dymaxion house Listerine Hard water Fecal incontinence Champagne (beverage) Garden Strawberry Copper Wallpaper group Biblical scientific foresight Textile manufacturing Car wash Bidet Hand washing Carpet Paper Ozone Hydrogen peroxide Ice resurfacer Plating Coir Autonomous building Jackass: The Movie Mattress Kosher foods Cheese Upholstery Dairy Pepper spray Water mould Bleach Bulk vending Laundry Water Cleanliness National Kidney Foundation Singapore Nocturnal emission Home repair Domestic water system Tattoo Caving Japanese tea ceremony My Name Is Earl Toilet humour Electrostatic precipitator Pet skunk Salah Ammonia Air pollution Smegma Social rule Unclean animals Body piercing Hebburn Penrose tiling Bleach (manga) Irrigation Xanadu House Queensbridge Genericized trademark Agricultural wastewater treatment Industrial wastewater treatment Fountain White phosphorus incendiary Glossary of nautical terms Drill bit
