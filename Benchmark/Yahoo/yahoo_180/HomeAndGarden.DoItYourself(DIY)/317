need info on how to build a dog pen using chain link fence over a wood frame pictures if possible i probably wouldn't use chain link for the weight factor but i can't see a need to diagram this all you really need do is visualize a house in its rough stage of framing if you know the dimensions you want just get busy using treated x 's determine a height x width x length and build the frame chain link sold in rolls at farm stores fencing companies even hd or lowes is often ft x ft if that won't work for you then you'll have to find it in ft height using a wooden frame you'll have to use galvanized horse shoe nails perhaps depending on the dimensions you'll have to unclude support beams both upright and across any roof you might want if the dogs are jumpers you might have to enclose it anyway that would also equate if you have any zoning issues regarding animals i'd probably go with inch galvanized plumbing pipe rather than lumber for one thing it would probably outlast any dog and perhaps any owner as well cut or purchase in the sizes you need threaded at the ends adding to that degree elbows and t junctions for the supporting pipes then stretch the chain link using all the usual appropriate hardware used when putting up a chain link fence you can allow for a gate somewhere in the plan and purchase one ready made if your budget allows steven wolf Seismic retrofit Wood Basement Antioch, Pisidia Nuclear fallout Retaining wall King Khalid International Airport Ammunition Sail-plan Masonry Freedom Tower Nuclear weapon design Bicycle frame Severe weather terminology (United States) Air-raid shelter Great Pyramid of Giza Dam Dundas Square Soil Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Natural building Water (molecule) Las Vegas metropolitan area Hydrogen economy Portable stove Tank Suspension bridge Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve Wind Volleyball Civil engineering Radio masts and towers Sport utility vehicle Magnesium Environmental concerns with electricity generation Fan (implement) Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Passenger car Isotope separation Equine conformation Geodesic dome Great Wall of China Anchor Leather Trench warfare Hobie cat Arch bridge Hubert H.
