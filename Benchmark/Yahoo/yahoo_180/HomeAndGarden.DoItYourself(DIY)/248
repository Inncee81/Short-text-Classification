attaching brick to studs ok so ive given myself a project to build a shelter barn shed well see what it turns out like then see what we can use it for so i can lay bricks for the walls of this barn but how do i attach the upright wood studs to the brick is there anything inbetween i need to know about or can the wooden studs be attached to the brick wall just by concrete screws the rest i have knowledge on like electric plastering but im just stuck on this part i dont wanna start building and end up in a pickle mid way my knowledge is on building is pretty intermidate i ghuess you could say many thanks in advance well for a shed you dont really need to have a timber frame you can just have double brick wall with piers and then you can have your rafters sitting on the brick wall cavities are mainly for protecting the building from moisture but if its not an inhabited building you can just have structural brick walls the rule is you cant have a freestanding brick wall that exceeds square meters so place ur piers as required at the end of the day the most important thing would be ur slab LaTeX Condom Casting Paint Menstrual cup Primer (paint) Mattress Percy Schmeiser Car wash Tattoo Strap-on dildo Fire fighting Markup language Japanese tea ceremony All My Children Diving suit Carbon fiber Gas metal arc welding Rubber Concrete Brewery Microphone Asbestos First aid M16 (rifle) Radio controlled airplane Herbicide Weed control Geodesic dome Balloon Christmas tree Two-stroke cycle Processor register Latex Toilet paper Gesso Diaphragm (contraceptive) Urban beach TeX Ice rink 64-bit Curling Fume hood Cartridge (firearms) Nitroglycerin Air pollution Distributed computing Trumpet Bullet Airport Endowment (Mormonism) Cave diving Pessary Paper plane Coir Explosive material Fancy rat Thermal power station Dry cleaning Chewing gum DNA polymerase Handloading Air traffic control Carburetor Electrostatic precipitator Autonomous building White phosphorus incendiary Pastel Aluminium Diseases of the honeybee Ira Steven Behr Chromatography Lignin Opium Internal ballistics Dundas Square Hand grenade Friction Soap Vinegar Cell (biology) Fisting Yoko Ono Arcade cabinet Butt plug Mixing console Jason Behr Blue Man Group Canary Ryan's Hope Pinoy Big Brother IA-32 Information warfare Medical prescription Hard disk Earth's atmosphere Sex doll Ozone layer RISC Exxon Valdez oil spill
