drilling into an rsj to fit a blind just to start things off i'm completely ignorant of diy construction so please bear with me i've recently moved into a property and need to fit a blind in the kitchen i've been told that there's a steel joist above the window and this will be cause problems to fit a blind if top fixing my question is firstly is it possible to drill into the rsj to fit a blind and if so is it a diy job or do you need to get the professionals in with specialist drilling equipment to get through the steel first of all it will not be an rsj but a galvanised steel box lintel you will need a tidy drill and a hss drill bit there are two ways to do it either use a mm drill bit and a red rawplug or mm drill bit with a brown rawplug or use a smaller bit and a selt tapping screw about inches long and screw it straight into the lintel drill the lintel slowly as the bit might catch on the metal and force the drill around which could damage your wrist no specialist equipment is neccessary have fun Seismic retrofit Linoleum Hamster Casting Drill bit Carbon dioxide Dialysis Water (molecule) Soldering Kitchen Knife Aerial (dance move) Plastic Diving suit Gas metal arc welding Drowning Dairy Japanese cuisine Ice Wood RuneScape quests Pottery Bong Coffee Volleyball Radon Lake Sea ice Chromatography Paint Tank Mattress Woodworking Firefighter Sushi Water Thermal power station Refrigerator Textile manufacturing Manicure Francis Bacon (painter) Sento Basement Tofu Cruising (maritime) Enceladus (moon) Charles Goodyear Glacier Plywood Glossary of firefighting equipment Tire Microwave oven Novelty (locomotive) Disc brake Brewery IBM PC compatible Naval mine Internal ballistics Haloalkane Heinkel He 112 Saw Geology of the Grand Canyon area Floppy disk Flood geology Idli Card scraper Dry cleaning Upholstery Vermicompost Katana John Hancock Tower Japanese toilet Electrophysiology Dead Sea Leaf Death Valley National Park Oscilloscope Gilding Champagne (beverage) Airsoft Deck (ship) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Wok 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Spark plug Plate tectonics Bulldozer Piano Printed circuit board Europa (moon) Solar cell Opportunity rover Lighting Instant coffee Tobacco Roof Comanche The Emancipation of Mimi Comet Illegal drug trade
