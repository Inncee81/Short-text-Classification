what do i use to seal acrylic keychains i've got these acrylic keychains i want to sell and give as gifts they're the kind that just snap together one piece inside the other with a photo sandwiched in the middle trouble is they don't snap tight so they can easily come apart and i want them to stay sealed any idea what i should use to do that i've tried this loctite clear household silicone but in order for it to work i have to really smear it on which leaves visible residue over the photo on the closing side any other suggestions thanks look for an acrylic glue it comes in a small bottle with an applicator at the end it dissolves the acrylic on both pieces then re bonds as one piece Upholstery Kennington Park Christmas tree Kimono 1957 World Series Sewing Clothing Tallit Kilt Textile manufacturing terminology The Tortilla Curtain Mattress Statue of Liberty Joey Skaggs Gram staining Sangha Rich's Great Tree Dye The Brady Bunch Futurama Homelessness The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Comanche Animal rights Hair coloring New York Yankees Xbox 360 Hunter-gatherer One Tree Hill (TV series) Textile manufacturing Yarn Christmas Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Knots Landing Salvation Army Garfield Animal shelter Applique Highty-Tighties Xmas Staining (biology) Christina Aguilera 2005 Kashmir earthquake Mission UK Santa Claus The Price Is Right Sarong RuneScape quests The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Han Chinese clothing Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Shroud of Turin Angels in America Crucifixion Tyrian purple Honey and Clover Target Corporation Do They Know It's Christmas?
