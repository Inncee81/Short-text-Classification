how to paint an unfinished spice rack spray or latex primer i have unfinished pine pieces i'll use as a spice rack they're like open top boxes to be mounted on the wall i'd like to paint them but i wasn't looking for a huge costly project i thought i could just spray paint them is primer absolutely necessary would it be just as easy to use brush on paint and primer i'm not looking for perfect results and i don't want to buy lots of tools such primer is necessary on any bare surface you could paint these without primer the paint will probably stick but you will have to use several coats to get a consistent coverage best to go ahead and use primer buying the primer will be cheaper than using several coats of paint spray paint should be fine for this project both the primer and the paint make sure the products you select are designed for use on wood this will likely end up being oil based paint there are few if any latex based spray paints that work well oil based paint is a bit messier to clean up but you would not have any brushes to deal with spray outside if possible use paper or plastic to catch the overspray and cleanup should be minimal if you don't want to spray a good latex paint would be a good choice as well latex primer for wood not drywall primer you should be able to buy a quart maybe even pint or half pint paint should be an acrylic latex Gramophone record Upholstery Compact disc Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) Tattoo Vinyl roof Acetic acid Dodge Charger Studebaker Gran Turismo Hawk Auto racing Canadian Auto Workers Inkjet printer Lincoln Continental Mark III Technicolor Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Hair coloring De Lorean DMC-12 Volkswagen Golf Ford GT Bouncy techno Polyvinyl chloride Ford Thunderbird ZX Spectrum Ford Cortina Norwich Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Hydrogen chloride Tire Glasses Mattress CBC Radio One Lincoln Continental Mark IV Oil refinery RoadShow AFI (band) Sears Holdings Corporation Magnetism Lamborghini Diablo Ford Mustang The Smashing Pumpkins Disc brake Nine Inch Nails Mercury Cougar BMW E34 Insurance Aluminium Tokusatsu USS Seawolf (SS-197) Linoleum Need for Speed Welding Autorack USS Saury (SS-189) P-Phenylenediamine Hot Coffee mod Judge (band) Marilyn Monroe Textile Knight Rider The Microphones Skype Electronic commerce Bus models used in New York City Transit High school subcultures Tzitzit We Belong Together Dye CD-R Food coloring Billy Bragg Benzene Worcestershire sauce Phoenicia The Beatles discography Label Cracking (chemistry) Topology glossary Plasticizer Anodising Grand Theft Auto 2 Seismic retrofit Photographic film Live 8 Corrosion Domain Name System Amtrak Cosmetics Amazon.com L'Or__al David Dubinsky Screw USS Volador (SS-490) Electrostatics Blue Heelers Vow (Garbage song) Lemon Jelly Federal Way, Washington Audiophile Cadillac Eldorado Wal-Mart
