hardibacker in front of tub i'm installing hardibacker around my tub the problem is the next stud in front of the tub is about away so there is an gap between the front of the tub and the next stud the cut will be l shaped from the top of the tub going down the front i can still screw the one end of the backerboard to to the stud in front of the tub i'm only worried about the area of the backerboard in front of the tub will it be sturdy or will it break because there's no support behind it what can i do about it thanks just as simple as shawnd says add blocking by toenailing it into the existing studs or just add another stud or add a blocking piece going horizontal from one stud to the other then a short stud from the blocking to the plate that should give you plenty to secure the tub to Screw Drill bit Bong Textile manufacturing Pottery Glossary of firefighting equipment Hydraulic machinery Seismic retrofit Plumbing fixture Breastfeeding Gag (BDSM) VHS Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Computer Knife Diving regulator Professional wrestling holds Glossary of climbing terms Plastic Strap-on dildo Baby bottle Ammunition Thermal power station Computer forensics Domestic water system Chevrolet Corvair engine Anchor Carpet Bassoon Basement Amateur telescope making Electrical wiring DragonFly BSD Casting Radio controlled airplane Violin Macro photography Linux Dialysis Climbing equipment Equine conformation Dishwasher Pump Top-bar hive Tire Rigging Diving cylinder Canal lock Japanese toilet Wire Windows 2000 M60 machine gun IPod Trombone Bicycle Serial Hydrotherapy Masturbation Sail-plan Nintendo Revolution Swimming pool Siphon Abdomen Mach kernel Toilet paper Ice cream Diving suit Solar power Windows XP Spark plug Handloading Oxy-fuel welding and cutting PlayStation 2 Scuba set Snorkel CPU cache Mattress Neutrino Fixed-gear bicycle Two-stroke cycle Hand grenade Escapology Apollo Command/Service Module ZX Spectrum Firearm Nudity Sega Saturn Menstrual cup Urinary incontinence Professional wrestling throws Shroud of Turin Cartridge (firearms) Textile manufacturing terminology Skateboarding trick A Tale of a Tub Universal Serial Bus
