growing your own food i live near chicago area i have a large yard but i also have dogs i am hoping to eventually have a garden that will support two adults all year round i am a long way from that goal though i am just starting to plan it i can not actually till the earth so i have to use planters i am thinking about making my own out of cement blocks and putting a couple of layers of rocks and pebbles at the bottom for better drainage i don't have all the details worked out yet but my main questions are how do i start this garden what plants should i put in how do i protect the plants from winter weather and animals any other advice thank you the whole yard is fenced in but all the fences are covered by overgrown trees and shrubs from surrounding properties it's larger than most urban yards but it's not huge huge i'm not sure exactly how large and it's night right now so i can't measure it right now i'll get back to you on that there is a lot of shade because there are a lot of trees and the fences are covered with plants so it's really shady next to them it's fairly sunny in the middle of the back yard but we need that part for the dogs we can't till because we don't own the property and the owner won't let us is the area walled or fenced off from oter property how large length and width how much sun and shade and why can't you till it tell me those and i'll get right back to you edit ok thanks for the info three problems here owner's regulation on no tilling a lot of shade and very acid soil under the trees here's an approach that might work consider planting pea in theshady areas early in the spring before the trees are fully leaved i assume you are allowed to dig a hole for a plant so instead of a hole scartch up the area with a garden rake lay the peans on the ground and cover them with a mix of sand and bagged garden top soil to a level of about when they grow to or so start gradually adding some top soil to give them some support don't wory about planting them in neat straight rows just scatter them up and down the planting areas defined by the width of your rake later as they reach about put stakes along the row and tie strings between them to give the peas something to hold on to with the peas plant carrots the peas will help loosen the soil for the carrots to take hold get short fat carrots because the skinny ones just won't penetrate the soil well in the first year let them grow right in there with the peas as the the pea vines die off the carrots will come in behind them i would recommend snow peas or sugar pod peas the ones you eat pod and all aside from being fairly adaptable the peas will put nitrogen into the soil carrots actually take years to mature in the second year they put out attractive white blooms that look sort of like queen anne's lace so you can let them take the full years maybe you can put in rows instead of just around the dog area which i assume has some kind of fence of its own plant cucumber just along the outside of their fence as the vines grow train them to the fence so the cucumbers will be suspended as they grow and easy to pcik the dogs won't eat them plant just by making a hole about deep and dropping in a seed or every along the fence inside the doggies' area plant tomatoes and or peppers in pots the pots should be about deep use plants that have been started for you you can use the nice rich bagged soil and some fertilizer for these you'll need to support them as they grow either tie them to the dog fence or drive stakes in by the pots hint it is easier to use wire to tie the plants such as solid wire used for house wiring because you can bend it around plant stems and branches then use it again next year in the base of the tomatoe pots you can plant lettuce and spinach from seed after the season is over gather up the dead stems and vines break them up or shred them as much as possible and put them in a compost pile put vegetable waste peelings etc coffee grounds and broken egg shells in the pile from time to time and toss on some soil you can add some worms if you like the following year you'kll have some rich stuff and won't need to import as much it is tough to create a vegetable garden on an elevated surface or flat because you not only need adequate depth of soil but must control drainage as well if possible without getting into trouble cut away some of the tree limbs hanging over your area to let in a bit more sun good luck Climate of the United Kingdom Diving suit Sauna Diseases of the honeybee Motor oil K__ppen climate classification
