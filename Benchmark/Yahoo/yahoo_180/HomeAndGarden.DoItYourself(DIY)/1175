does blood clog drains i have a friend that is convinced her drain in her shower is clogged because she got a really bad cut on her foot earlier this week and when she was in the shower it bleed profusely and now her drain is clogged but it has been clogged for a while i think that the blood just maybe dried around hair or something but blood doesn't clog drains does it short answer no the way that a p trap is designed it would be nearly impossible for blood to clog a drain after the water runs down the drain there is a chamber that is filled with about cups of water this is referred to as a p trap its purpose is to seal out fumes from the sewer septic system that could be toxic she would have had to fill up the p trap with blood and then not ran the water for a few days to have the blood dry up enough for it to clog the drain there is to much water existing in the p trap it would have diluted the blood to much for this to happen what probably did happen was that there was an existing hair clog already in the drain and it just started to completely clog and flow water back into the fixture a conventional drain clog remover should get her back in business again if you need anything more powerful there is a product that is called liquid fire sulfuric acid that will clear anything that is down there Burglar alarm Crime prevention through environmental design Surveillance Microeconomics Combine (Half-Life 2) Mouse (computing) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Electrophysiology Traffic light Smoke detector Piezoelectricity Grandview, U.S.A.
