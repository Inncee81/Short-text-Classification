how to rid ants i have little redish ants all over my pc desk i never eat or drink by it soo i don't know y they are here i am not able to spend very much to get ride of them any low income ideas please would be great i do have kids simple all natural non toxic formula oatmeal you just by old fashioned oatmeal not the instant kind also called rolled oats you sprinkle a handful where the ants will find them preferably close to the hill if you know where it is because it takes them forever to haul it back home they take the raw rolled oats to the queen she eats it and then not kidding she blows up and then they wander off having no purpose left in life it takes a couple of days to see results but then you see less ants in a couple of days and pretty soon they're all gone i've done this several times and i'd swear by it four out of five times it's worked like a charm the fifth time i had to do two different applications because a new colony came and took over the vacated hill but then they left too i can't guarantee it works on all types of ants though since i've only ever tried it on black ants but it can't hurt anything to try and it won't hurt your kids if they come up and start eating it my five year old sister likes to eat rolled oats raw Clothing Kilt Textile manufacturing terminology Undergarment Skirt and dress Suit (clothes) Shirt Comanche Mattress Textile manufacturing Kimono Diamond cut Salwar kameez Chemise Knife Knitting Violin Playoff Pattern (sewing) Sarong Starfleet ranks and insignia Han Chinese clothing Bob Jones University Horse Academic dress of Oxford University Teen Girl Squad Heavy metal fashion Mario Stocking Dairy Order of the Garter Aloha shirt Quilting Glossary of American football Quilt Whose Line Is It Anyway?
