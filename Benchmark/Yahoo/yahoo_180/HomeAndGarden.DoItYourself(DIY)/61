professional stud finder in heat i am putting plugs into a room and i'm using a professional stud finder i've gone through two of these already costly every time i use it which i've read on the back exactly how to do it and i do exactly what it says it seems like the thing is in heat or something because its always finding a stud i thought maybe i forgot a detail not that hard to use according to directions so i reread it a few times but its always beeping at different points on the wall never consistent and the light comes on each time at a different point both machines do it what is going on here anything else i can use instead to find the stud thanks for your time responses and viewing you need to move the instrument across the wall at a slower speed moving it too fast make the density meter to reread it self off of the drywall moving it slowly across the area a few times should remedy the problem if it persists then there could be more obstacles inside of the wall like water pipes that are causing the false reading i have found that the best stud finder for me is a cow magnet a magnet that they feed to cows to stop any metals such as wire from entering into the intestines they are about long and in diameter and you can find them at any farm supply store to use it as a stud finder simply glue or tape a piece of string to one end and swing it pendulum style across the wall in question the magnet will stick to the nails or screws used to fasten the drywall to the studs so you will need to raise and lower it accordingly hope this helps Clinker (boat building) Screw Woodworking Drywall Strake Casting Upholstery Violin Seismic retrofit Textile manufacturing Mattress Boat building Gilding Bong Plaster Knife Timpani Plane (tool) Tire Motor oil Adobe Bacon Architecture of the California missions Stucco Welding Paint Temporal bone Manicure Volleyball Straw-bale construction Scapula Glossary of partner dance terms Shawn Michaels Nail (engineering) Dairy Carburetor Glossary of climbing terms Tofu Wrench Chopped & screwed Radio controlled airplane Sea ice Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Friction Lighting Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Adhesive Drawing Sand casting Strap-on dildo Electrical wiring Snooker Skateboarding trick Professional wrestling match types Tile Tin can Masonry Ammunition Ham Floyd Rose Oceanic trench Siphon Equine conformation Glaze Geology of the Grand Canyon area Repouss__ and chasing Ulna Mixed martial arts Bassoon Thermal power station Surrealist techniques Rail tracks Climbing equipment Printed circuit board Glacier Skateboard Point groups in three dimensions Bone fracture Painter and decorator Tobacco Nine Inch Nails Callus Montreal Screwjob Drowning A151 road Butterfly stroke Fast bowling Professional wrestling attacks Etching Guqin Soldering Spark plug Wire Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold Billiards Humerus
