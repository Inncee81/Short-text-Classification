would this work fabric room divider i want a divider in my room to have two sections and i'd like it to be fabric i want to hang the fabric from the ceiling like with a ceiling track my question is would it be easier cheaper to just hang a curtain rod on the ceiling and hang it from there to me it seems exactly like a regular window curtain would work my mom thinks it won't work anything else i could do or things i need to consider when hanging something from a ceiling i'm reading and re reading and re reading to make sure i get everything right you didn't say house or apartment or home so i'm guessing rental i love the track idea there has to be something out there to hang in the studs in the ceiling that you can clip onto the fabric either onto the fabric or onto grommets in the fabric as for the fabric itself wa ha rubbing my hands together you or your mom or someone has to know how to sew it just must be done or learned something then head out to the fabric store buy a gorgeous fabric that accents your living room over buy it in length so that you can get some great not pleats per se but waves like gathers you know what i'm saying make sure it is long enough to go from ceiling to floor depending on how you want it to look with the curtains open to the kitchen you can have it open to two sides and held back or you could do it into three sections and use scraps attached to the curtain sides to tie it as it goes back giving you two sides and a middle that would be just gorgeous now for the kitchen back i'm taking it your kitchen isn't really big enough to have people in it while you are in it so the backing really isn't going to matter however you will need something back there maybe a batting or something to make sure that grease from the kitchen doesn't get onto it also check your fabric to make sure it's washable maybe launder first before sewing to get the sizing correct because it's going to be between those rooms it will soak up the smells from the kitchen and may get stained sounds gorgeous and like something i had wanted to do for our theatre room in the basement have fun and good luck Kitchen Door Hamster Floppy disk Combine (Half-Life 2) The Brady Bunch Textile manufacturing JavaServer Pages Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Knife Sundial Frankfurt kitchen RuneScape quests Passenger car Refrigerator Betting (poker) Shaggy dog story Poker jargon Mozilla Firefox The Penultimate Peril TARDIS Sento Wood carving Bristol Grammar School Fancy rat Jumpstart 3rd Grade USB flash drive The Shining (film) StarCraft: Uprising McMansion PHP Richard Chase View camera B-47 Stratojet Station wagon Paper size Xanadu House Screw Japanese tea ceremony Bus models used in New York City Transit Laptop IPod Washing machine Unix Bong The Cure Abbey Casting Glossary of firefighting equipment Chainsaw Wrigley Field MTR OpenBSD The Time Machine Stove Animal Crossing Minor characters in Sonic the Hedgehog Mach kernel Bassoon Ammunition House IBM PC compatible Punch card Hard disk Paper towel Asbestos Window Violin Sushi Glossary of firefighting terms The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time The Ersatz Elevator Dishwasher Upholstery G-Man (Half-Life) Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore) Dean Koontz Glossary of nautical terms Elevator Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory The Truman Show Top-bar hive Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Shoe Spyware Domain Name System Secretary desk Items in the Metroid series Futurama (TV series - season 4) Fire fighting Seismic retrofit Chatsworth House Cyndi Lauper Opportunity rover Blood Simple Sin City Paragliding HyperText Transfer Protocol Kayak
