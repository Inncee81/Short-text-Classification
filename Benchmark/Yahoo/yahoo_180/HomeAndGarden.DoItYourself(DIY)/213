can somone tell me how to wire v lighting from a buss bar in series with switches lights total i have high pressre sodium lights i need to put up in my shop i have a buss bar with v made by bulldog i want to hook into a pull box and run power to three switchs as lights will work off one switch so i need i diagram or some advice i know what you're trying to do you have lamps that run on volts dividing it up in phases would be lamps on each phase that would total v phase to phase delta if wired in series it doesn't work that way i think wiring high pressure sodium lights in series is the craziest idea i've ever heard of these lamps have a ballast and a starter board that kicks the voltage for the bulb up to above volts to fire up once fired up the operating voltage actually drops down to about volt measured across the bulb socket with the unused voltage power rejected by the ballast you cannot wire these lights in series they need to get the proper voltage what they are made for and nothing else my wildest guess is that you would blow one starter board after another once you turn the switch on also the weakest bulb would burn out in a heartbeat you'd be constantly changing bulbs if this would work at all i should try this some day and laugh myself silly about it when it all blows up final advice let an electrician do this this is nothing to play with v hurts real bad i wouldn't want that to happen again you never know when it is the last time on second thought is this one of these tricks growers of particular plants are using to hide the power draw of their growing lights to be detected by the kw hour meter i know very well that very very strange things occur if you create a capacitive and inductive load with the addition of half wave rectifiers on a phase to phase circuit like the meter stopping or even turning backwards Casting Epoxy Paint Pottery Knife Dishwasher Plastic Welding Varnish Electric motor Glaze Bassoon Brush Stainless steel Boat building Glass Masonry Polystyrene Seismic retrofit Bicycle frame Gas metal arc welding Cookware and bakeware Carbon fiber Corrosion Internal ballistics Slide rule Model aircraft Printed circuit board Transformer Terminal ballistics Lacquer Textile manufacturing Fan (implement) Turquoise Microeconomics De Lorean DMC-12 Woodworking Polypropylene Radio controlled airplane Friction Upholstery Wind turbine Gilding Wallpaper group Paintball Light-emitting diode Drawing Operational amplifier Painter and decorator Aluminium Shoe polish Chinese art Organic peroxide Solar cell Iron Professional wrestling match types Screw Arcade cabinet Bicycle Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Magnetism Graphite-reinforced plastic Electrical wiring Wood carving Eyepiece Fiberglass Golden ratio Billiards Dental caries Seal (device) Bong Stucco Brewery Rail transport modelling Thermal power station Dishwashing Handloading Leica Floppy disk Soldering CPU cache Poker jargon Scale model China Steel Cartridge (firearms) Clarinet Tofu Electrophysiology Tire Diamond cut Canoe Ice cream Antenna (radio) Hydraulic machinery Strap-on dildo Lighting
