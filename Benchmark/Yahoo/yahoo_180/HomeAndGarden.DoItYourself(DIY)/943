is it abnormal to pee in the sink i never use the toilet i use the sink instead is this abnormal there is a yellow ring around the drain is there anyway i can remove that i've often wondered when i visit a home where there are no children why there was a step stool in the bathroom now i know do you defecate in the tub or shower or is that why your azalea's are the envy of all the neighbors now i would be really impressed if it were the kitchen sink but i think you are talking about the washbasin in the bathroom it's just so tacky to pee in the kitchen have you ever considered putting one of those giant sized urinal disks in the sink to keep it fresh and sweet smelling the little plastic holders even come in decorator colors and can be imprinted with don't drink and drive prevent date rape or seasonal holiday themes or disney characters just think how happy it would make you to be peeing on goofey or dumbo or even micky and minny but back to the yellow ring you could bleach it as others have suggested but i recall something about a chemical you can injest that makes you pee blue kind of what you would imagine the tidy bowl man would be doing that should work i don't want to get too personal but do you use a bidet is it the standard melenor lawn oscillating type or do you prefer the impulse spray variety Shelf life Stucco Casting Masonry Drill bit Plaster Alanis Morissette Straw-bale construction Dairy Mortar (masonry) Cement Tofu Cheese Badfinger Barbecue Natural building Food science Pottery Self-replication Cannabis cultivation Portland cement Plastic Packaging and labelling Phonograph cylinder Aldi Seismic retrofit Computus Food irradiation Twinkie Emergency preparedness Sarin RFID Fancy rat Menstrual cycle Collecting fossils Guinea pig Die making James Kochalka Ceramics Glossary of sculpting terms Mars Exploration Rover Red Hot Chili Peppers Trans fat Birth control Calcium Rockall Henry Moore Dennis Rader MRE Dental brace Oil well Dialysis Asbestos Food and Drug Administration Yoghurt Tori Amos Gypsum Hamster TLC Microprocessor Geometry Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Metal Gear Solid Roof Cocaine Steel Geodesic dome Aztalan State Park, Wisconsin Coffee Microwave oven Equine conformation Tamper-evident Medical prescription Orthopedic surgery Adjustable gastric band The Catcher in the Rye Timber framing Acne PlayStation 2 The League of Gentlemen (comedy) R.E.M.
