what do i do if i have a drill bit stuck is the drill bit stuck in the drill or is it stuck in the material you were drilling if it's stuck in the drill you'll just need a strong grip and some muscle to loosen it if it's stuck in the material make sure the bit is secured very tightly in the drill so the drill won't just spin around it set the drill on reverse and do your best to back it out if that doesn't work take the drill off leaving the material and the bit and use some pliers or vise grips to try and wiggle the bit out if it won't damage the material you can try spraying some wd on the bit to lubricate it and make it easier to remove alternatively you could put some graphite powder on it to encourage it to move more easily Plastic Water (molecule) Solvent Hydrochloric acid Aluminium Cyanoacrylate Fiberglass Tooth Opportunity rover Soap Steel Explosive material Carbon Seismic retrofit Welding Stucco Protein Ozone depletion Alkane Tooth enamel Corrosion Titanium Gelatin Ammonia Resin Ozone hole Iron Flood geology Acetic acid Sulfur Coffee Biochemistry Ice core Polymer Vitamin C Benzene Knife Brewery Casting Silicon Brazing Portland cement Tissue engineering Epoxy Haloalkane Glacier Terminal ballistics Water Ultraviolet Paint Leather Hydrogen peroxide Teflon Phase (matter) Illegal drug trade Magnesium Alum Wood Glass Carbon nanotube Industrial process Human skin color Crocodilia Sulfuric acid Liquid crystal Concrete Hydrogen chloride Hand grenade Geology of the Moon Alcohol Vulcanization Roof Tuff Sperm Whale Hippopotamus Great Lakes Ceramics Antarctic krill SpongeBob SquarePants Mineral Diving Ethyl acetate Mattress Uranium Coal Cheese Aspartame Zinc Industrial wastewater treatment Dead Sea Sodium Chromatography
