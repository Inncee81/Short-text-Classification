painting tips i'm painting most of the rooms in my house and i'm having problems with getting paint on the ceiling and trim i am using the blue painters tape but when i remove it the paint has seeped through or the tape pulls at the paint any suggestions i am also painting the trim and finding it very tedious i have a drop cloth over my carpet but it not adequate is there an easier way to paint it any and all painting tips are appreciated painting trim just sucks and is slow going are you doing the painting in the right order ceiling first then trim two coats and last are walls i use a roller on the ceiling in angled trim brush and paint pads for walls you shouldn't be dripping a lot of paint unless you are putting too much on pad brush when you load it as far as cutting in trim work the angled brush is the key and use your left hand to steady underneath the right hand as you paint never use blue tape unless i'm doing stripes and it's all about painting from the top and drawing down if the tape is at the top of the wall or reverse if the tape is at bottom of wall so that you are not shoving paint up under the tape remove tape while paint is still wet painting just takes practice which you should have plenty of by the time you finish the house best of luck keep at it i allow one day per room to finish ceiling and four walls always painting two coats each place Do it yourself World Wide Web Uniform Resource Locator DIY ethic HyperText Transfer Protocol Website BMW HTTP cookie Home improvement Web server Uniform Resource Identifier Blenheim Palace Wilton House Xanadu House Virtual hosting Internet Molding (decorative) Wget White House HTML Gmail Mozilla Firefox Representational State Transfer Sistine Chapel Web browser Leeds Electronic commerce Casting House of Leaves Unicode and HTML Wireless Application Protocol Diablo II Squid cache JavaServer Pages Straw-bale construction Kitchen Common Unix Printing System Web crawler Quotation mark Cruise missile Independent Media Center Mozilla Application Suite Irish Houses of Parliament Phishing Spyware Flickr Opera house Home repair Rachel Whiteread The Waterboys Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Bratislava Castle Hamster London Home & Garden Television Wi-Fi Time Inc.
