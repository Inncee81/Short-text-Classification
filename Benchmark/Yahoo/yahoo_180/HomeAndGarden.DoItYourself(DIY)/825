when do i need to use a ridge vent and or soffit vents i'm building a shed and the plans that i have calls for putting in a ridge vent and a soffit vent do i really need to put these in i thought vents were for better air circulation and are a necessity for an air conditioned building do i need these in a non airconditioned shed if they are needed can i get away with just putting a ridge vent in or do they both need to work in conjunction with each other venting will prevent moisture bulid up it also helps to control the temp in the summer time with no venting a shed will easily heat up to or degrees inside ridge venting and soffit venting work together so one without the other is far less effective than having both together an easier way to vent is to put two peak vents also called wall vents in each on opposing sides of the shed near the peak of the roof these are usually easier to install and do almost as good of a job as soffit and ridge venting Basement Kitchen HVAC Central heating Scottish Parliament Building Demolition Air-raid shelter North York, Ontario Seismic retrofit International Finance Centre Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew Mechanical floor Eddie Guerrero Firefighter Japanese toilet Lighting Chatsworth House Dundas Square Furnace Mosaic Palladian architecture Collapse of the World Trade Center Bristol Grammar School Solar power Brewery 30 St Mary Axe Timber framing Villa Farnese John Hancock Tower Sento Autonomous building Dealey Plaza Insulation HSBC Hong Kong headquarters building Eaton's Radiator Hebden Bridge Zhengding Deck (ship) Electrical wiring Cray-1 Renewable energy Singapore Flyer New Lanark Passive solar Roman villa Apartment building Epoxy Edward Lovett Pearce Spark plug Elevator Bloody Stupid Johnson Radon Richard Cassels Heat exchanger New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Tate Modern Stairway Library Carpet Reservoir Dogs Tour CIBC Multi-storey car park University of Central Florida Inventory Spyware Platform framing Virginia State Capitol Shotgun house Multi-level marketing Stove Florida Institute of Technology Sicilian Baroque Emerson College New York Stock Exchange Fire alarm control panel Central processing unit Racquetball Fire fighting American University Portsmouth Block Mills Paul Martin __ras an Uachtar__in Robert Lawson (architect) Geodesic dome The Helix Heat David Lee Roth Windows XP Parliament of Finland Home improvement Caracas Red Ribbon Army Chevrolet Corvair King Khalid International Airport Alain Robert Thermae AMC V8 engine
