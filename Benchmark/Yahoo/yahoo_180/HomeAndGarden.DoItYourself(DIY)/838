help for installing a shower into a tub i have a tub with no shower i need to install the shower and necessary plumbing how much would a plumber charge how much would it cost to do it myself and how difficult is it if you can unscrew the tub spout you're in business if the tub is reasonably modern the spout probably does unscrew but it may take some muscle to budge it at first take that spout to lowes of hd or a decent hardware store and tell them you want the same thing except with a diverter valve and nipple i'm not making this up here's a picture to give you the general iea http www neatitems com images diverter spout jpg note that in the picture there's a white plastci threaded connection the nipple in the botom other kinds will have it on the top or somewhere else anyway when you pull the pop up stem on the spout the water is diverted to the nipple that's where you attach a hand held shower which has a pack so you can affix it to the wall of the shower so it works lie an ordinary shower head cheap fix and you get both shower and tub functionality by the way you may need no tools at all to do this but you should get a spool of pipe tape this is thin teflon tape you wrap around the threads of the nipple to make it water tight when you attach the shower head extension you should also apply it to the nipple coming out of the wall when you put on the new spout enjoy Wood Stairway Mount St. Helens Opportunity rover Chair 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens Terminal ballistics USS Scorpion (SS-278) Newspaper Langstroth hive Grand Union Canal Transport Workers Union of America Volcano Pachypodium key to species Oil well Dundas Square Diamond Yellowstone National Park Mount Vesuvius Pachypodium ambongense Tire Hot dog Torpedo Audio tape length and thickness CPU cache 19-inch rack Unemployment Cremation Pachypodium bicolor Thermal power station Cartridge (firearms) Investigation into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 Wishbone Ash Oldsmobile Toronado Pachypodium baronii Daewoo Nubira Outsourcing Breathing gas Tuff Apollo Command/Service Module Geography of the United Kingdom Mount Pinatubo Coppersmith Narrow gauge London Bridge Dodge Challenger Kurdistan Workers Party Fossil fuel power plant Paper size History of the Panama Canal Laws of cricket Brachiopod Pixel Early IBM disk storage Yellow Grass, Saskatchewan Percussion cap Aspect ratio (image) Dot matrix printer Amateur telescope making Buick Skylark Wayne Corporation Gramophone record Harley-Davidson Poliwag Ford Mustang Dodge Charger Items in the Metroid series Pikachu Scale model Type O Negative History of cricket Micrometer Geologic time scale Large format Billiards Oak Island Shotgun Cookware and bakeware Diode Naval mine Wood router View camera O scale Legion of Merit Seattle Mariners M16 (rifle) USS Nautilus (SS-168) Single bullet theory Pok__mon Yellow Iowa class battleship English longbow Bed (furniture) Quake III Arena Mid-size car Wood fuel Carbine Campfire Diego Garcia Abacus Project HARP
