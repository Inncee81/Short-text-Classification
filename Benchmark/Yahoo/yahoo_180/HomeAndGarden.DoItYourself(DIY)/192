removing union between pump and filter help i am trying to replace a yr old pool pump with a new hayward hp unit i need a recommendation on how to remove the union that connects the pump to the de filter my issues is that when i turn the union assuming counter clockwise is correct and also having another wrench securing the threadeded side connected to the filter the threaded side connecting to the pump will tighten until it cannot go anymore if the union piece is only supposed to turn then let me know otherwise the hacksaw is comming out to seperate the pieces lol also thinking of using strong flex tubing clamps to connect once i remove additional info if i replace with another union can i buy this from home depot is the standard inch can i use pvc what you are describing sounds like a coupling and not a union it also sounds a little like there isn't even a coupling only a piece of pipe between the two take both the pump and filter off the stand as an assembly one of the parts has to be able to turn completely around this shouldn't be to hard as there are probably some mounting screws holding both the pump and or the filter to a base take both parts off the base remove the filter remove the pipe throw away the pump connect the pipe to the new pump connect the filter to the pipe align the pump and filters to the mounting holes and re attach the assembly to the mounting bracket then connect the power to the pump and check for leaks make sure you use some pipe dope of teflon tape on the threads one last note make sure you leave about a turn in the tight direction on the filter after you screw down your pump then turn the filter in the tight direction to the proper position this will ensure your filter is in the proper postion and the joints are tight no leaks hope this helps Glass Drill bit Saw Window Boat building Amateur telescope making Weapon Woodworking Snooker Wood router Lawn mower Chisel Textile manufacturing Bong Windows Vista Wood carving Sunroof Obsidian Compact disc Stereoscopy Drawing Diamond simulant 35 mm film Screw Grind Movie projector Parachute STS-114 Radio controlled airplane Textile manufacturing terminology Bicycle frame View camera Spark plug Jute Portsmouth Block Mills Sandpaper Door Stained glass MPEG-2 Fencing Digital Signal 1 Upholstery Panoramic photography Solar power Mattress Lightning rod Electrical wiring Lathe Chopper (motorcycle) Sextant Cube (film) Scissors Stage lighting Laser engraving Lapping Harp EIA-708 Glasses Toilet paper Bowie knife Computer animation Axe Razor Floppy disk Naval mine Ethernet Lighting Die (manufacturing) Float glass Glossary of firefighting equipment Page table Anaglyph image Table tennis Widescreen Gramophone record Timpani Packet Adze Bedbug Cinematography RX-78 mobile suit series Photographic lens Comanche PaX Filter (optics) Crown glass Plough RuneScape Random Events Plastic Hand grenade Table saw Tire Photograph Seismometer Snowboard GIF Time-division multiplexing Chevrolet Corvette Sword
