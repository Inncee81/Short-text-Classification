y r is kevin going to fall for jenna again now he is out trying to get money for her brain operation how long are these to going to play head games before someone gets hurt i believe kevin is having some complicated tug of war issues with his love for jana you have to remember that there was no break up no problems between them leading up to a break up in order to give him closure all the way up to her holding up a gun to them and locking them in the freezer he was madly in love with her and sick with worry for her life then after he thinks he finally rescued her and colleen she locks the door and sets it on fire now that he has gotten past the anger pain and frustration of finding her to get some closure in his relationship with her and to find out why she did this he is seeing that there may have been a brain tumor that may have contributed to her seemingly out of character behavior to him anyway so now he feels that if he helps her get better mentally that she will go back to the same old jana that he was in love with and the reason she tried to hurt him will go away it's all a matter of him missing the way it was before and subconsciously making excuses and reasons to fix the broken jana so he can have his old life back just my opinion angela Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Sin City Traumatic brain injury Philip J.
