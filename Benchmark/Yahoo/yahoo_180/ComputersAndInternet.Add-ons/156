could a thunderstorm have fried my linksys wireless broadband router we had a nasty storm last night power outages all over the city now my wireless b band router doesn't work at all no power i think the surge protector saved my pc because that works fine the router's plugged into the same power strip i guess my housemates won't be using their machines until they pony up for a new router extremely possible i lost a computer like that last year during a thunderstorm power outage you could check the cables or try plugging it into another outlet but more than likely it's fried i feel for you but it could be worse it could have happened to your computer Router Cisco Systems Wi-Fi Power strip Modem Universal Serial Bus Wireless LAN Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Disaster Embedded system Digital Subscriber Line Voice over IP Telephone AppleTalk Nintendo DS 2003 North America blackout Denial-of-service attack Wireless access point Wireless Federal Standard 1037C Climate of Salt Lake City Network address translation Xbox PlayStation 3 Hurricane Wilma Power line communication Personal computer BS 1363 Streaming media Futurama (TV series - season 5) IEEE 802.11 Emergency preparedness IP (complexity) ZigBee Nintendo Revolution Internet Ethernet Local area network Tornado Futurama (TV series - season 2) Password Computer surveillance Telegraphy Severe weather terminology (United States) Hotspot (wifi) Bad Wolf Hurricane Katrina effects by region AT&T Big Brother (USA TV series) Weather forecasting Atlanta metropolitan area Border Gateway Protocol Floppy disk Onion Routing The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy HomePNA Extension Cord EastEnders Big Brother UK series 5 Computer forensics Skype Linux LAN party Drill bit Canadian Broadcasting Corporation USB flash drive Broadband Internet access Mouse (computing) Big Brother (Australian TV series) Messiahs in fiction and fantasy The Young Ones (TV series) FireWire WRT54G Cable television Futurama (TV series - season 3) Industrial and multiphase power plugs and sockets Spark plug Bell Labs Climate of the United Kingdom Quality of service Uninterruptible power supply Relay CPU cache Wireless network Bluetooth Radio Broadcom House of M Mobile ad-hoc network Wireless community network Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Tropical cyclone Thunderstorm Amateur radio Wood router MAC address Reading spark plugs for racing Gender of connectors and fasteners Deus Ex: Invisible War Father Ted
