what is d mark i heard its supposed to show you your graphics card's performance how do i use d mark and what is a benchmark i have a gts mb btw its a benchmark from futuremark a benchmark is a score the higher the better you fire the prog up and it goes thru a series of tests then gives you the score good for experimenting with overclocking and drivers even not overclocked if d mark locks up when running it you have driver issues or something if you click online result browser at end of test you can go to the website and save your scores and compare them to others with the same card or cpu and see how you fare you will have to get a username password for that free sometimes the highest cpu or video card clock or latest drivers does not give you the highest scores it does not yet support vista so don't bother downloading it its massive if you have vista you can also fire it up and click demo and it makes nice eye candy if you want to show off your video card a good tool for overclockers to test the clock if d mark doesn't lock up then the clock will usually run windows and most games without a prob here s the website with the downloads and info http www futuremark com Overclocking Radeon Windows Vista Windows XP IBM PC compatible Mac OS X v10.4 GeForce 6 Series ATI Technologies Video game music Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis PlayStation 3 Commodore 64 Macromedia Flash NVIDIA IPod Minesweeper (computer game) BitTorrent Opera (web browser) Benchmark (computing) Linux Athlon PlayStation Portable Mozilla Firefox CPU cache GeForce Gmail Xbox 360 Spyware PlayStation 2 Doom 3 GeForce 2 Phishing AmigaOS Pentium 4 3dfx Screenshot History of Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows Sega Dreamcast Uniform Resource Locator Password Celeron Atari ST Java programming language RISC NiGHTS Into Dreams Nintendo DS Internet fraud Object Desktop MAME CPU design Trusted computing Gaia Online RuneScape cheats Game programmer Secure Digital card Nintendo GameCube MMORPG Xbox Cheating in Counter-Strike Atari 8-bit family Game programming DirectX Cross site scripting Portable Document Format FLOPS GameFAQs Prank flash Windows 2000 Oracle database X Window System Wget Nintendo Revolution Central processing unit Game show World Wide Web GeForce 7 Series Windows 3.x Computer and video game genres Novell NetWare Amiga History of Test cricket (1884 to 1889) Mandriva Linux Microsoft Front side bus MDAC Grand Prix Legends OpenGL Streaming media Mozilla Application Suite Graphics card Stopping e-mail abuse
