on a geforce gt graphics card what does the gt stand for and also whats the difference between gt and gs in the name geforce gt the gt actually stands for gigatonne a metric measure of mass which is why the gt is more powerful than the gs however the gs stands for general speed and this is reflected in their speed difference with the gt then on to the difference between the two cards the gt has better clock and memory speeds although the video memory is the same and the stream processors used to be called pixel pipelines in the and series of nvidia cards are more in the gt than the gs the gtx is basically a supercharged version of a gt and also the gtx ultra such as the geforce gtx ultra is normally the fastest card in that family although gs cards are normally scorned at they are actually quite good ok the clock speeds are not as fast as the gt or gtx but if your using the card for watching videos and playing less demanding games these are ideal i hope this helps good luck mate GeForce 6 Series GeForce 7 Series Radeon GeForce 4 NVIDIA PlayStation 3 GeForce FX Radeon X Series GeForce 2 3dfx GeForce 3 GeForce 256 Overclocking Xbox IMac Graphics processing unit RISC Counter-Strike Central processing unit Windows Vista Nintendo CPU cache Apple Macintosh Pentium 4 Cell (microprocessor) NForce2 Atari 8-bit family Nintendo Entertainment System Voodoo 5 Apple II family PC Engine Yu-Gi-Oh!
