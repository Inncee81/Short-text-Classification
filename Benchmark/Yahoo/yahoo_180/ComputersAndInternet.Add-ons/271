can is format my system drive using xp pro cd and install vista after format someone told me about this he tried using vista cd to format his system drive but it didn't format the whole system drive some files remains in the drive after formatting using vista cd so he tried to format the drive using xp pro cd and he installed vista after format btw i am trying to do a clean install of vista to replace my xp you can do it that way or use a boot disk i like using a boot disk cuz i can check for dos non dos and logical partitions remove them all then partition and format the drive but i work on puters for a living so i'm not sure how the customer's drives are set up you don't have to use xp and format it in ntfs as vista will see the fat and convert it for you your friends puter may have had a logical partition on his drive he didn't know about and that may be why vista didn't format the whole drive some progs create logical partitions on hard drives one customer brought a puter in cuz after he installed xp after formatting it with xp his machine was trying to boot off the logical partiton and he had no clue where the partiton came from don't freak if vista tells you it cant install to your fat formatted drive as it turns around converts it to ntfs instantaneously and installs anyway make sure you have any f drivers on a floppy or cd vista takes both and have them in your drive when vista prompts for the install drivers it doesn't have you hit f and the screen goes black for long periods of time during installation which makes someone installing vista for the first time think something is wrong but its normal NTFS File Allocation Table MS-DOS Windows 2000 DOS AmigaOS File system Windows XP Partition (computing) Booting Computer virus Atari 8-bit family History of Microsoft Windows Redundant array of independent disks Disk cloning Floppy disk Blue screen of death Hard disk Knoppix USB flash drive System 7 (Macintosh) IBM PC compatible FreeDOS Linux SAM Coup__ Embedded system Drive letter assignment Ghost (software) ZX Spectrum Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis BIOS Commodore 64 CP/M Windows 3.x LiveCD Atari ST Commodore DOS Copy protection System/36 IPod Flash memory Apple Macintosh Enterprise content management NTFS junction point X86 DOS Comparison Original Amiga chipset Fritz-chip Architecture of Windows 2000 TRS-80 System/34 File format PlayStation 2 Common Unix Printing System Surveillance DragonFly BSD GRand Unified Bootloader Amstrad CPC Team Fortress Classic IBM PC Macromedia Flash Dual boot Atari DOS OS/2 Hierarchical File System Fdisk NeXT History of the graphical user interface DR-DOS Commodore 128 Apple IIGS Defragmentation Malware Disk operating system Universal Serial Bus Macintosh Finder Stardock PC-DOS Symbolic link RAM disk Sin City Btrieve Windows Me Dd (Unix) Windows Server 2003 Power Macintosh G3 Rootkit Jumpstart 3rd Grade Object Desktop Mac OS X Spring operating system
