how can i create an animated tv series i'm only but i want to have one in the future i don't want to be the animator but i want to be the god of it ya' know the producer the director the creator kinda like the ceo of it anyway how can i start now thanks a billion i don't want to do it all i know i'll need a lot of emplyees it's not about generating ideas for your stories as well when you say creator you must put yourself as well in the shoes of the creator authors your employees animators and peers it all started from the bottom until you should understand the situation more better than your employees and peers and lead them well to success i would say go to that field of interest and study about it more animation knowing the process and applying them correctly gives you the advantage to create the stuff and finish it in time because those who command with a high post without understanding the hardship of their peers and employees will not gain respect and voluntary compliance from the people below him her in worst case it can result to early disbandment if the future of studio company would lead to loss rather than profit one of the examples of consequences for not doing so is the son of hayao miyazaki he's an it based graduate yet he strayed to become an animation director to take over his father's place his outcome of the show received alot more complaints and criticism than compliments from movie critiques and reviewers alike it somehow tarnished the good name and reputation that hayao miyazaki built for his studio that it guy is kind of like a stranger to the animation world for he had no background of animation movie making field and just barged in to his father's studio to become a director i say it again put yourself into understanding how people work to produce animations and movies work along with them and you can hope to see a future in those higher post you mentioned yeah i agree with the guy above you need portfolio's of your work to prove yourself a capable person Hayao Miyazaki Theory of conduct Microeconomics Extreme Programming Plame affair Pretty Good Privacy Machinima Corporate governance Hideaki Anno Supply and demand Modern animation of the United States Peer review Spirited Away Capitalism Ra (board game) Empire Burlesque Mamoru Oshii Pixar Anarchism and capitalism Joe Hisaishi Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water Theodicy Labor theory of value Software engineering Pok__mon (anime) Copyright Mutual fund Computer animation Prisoner's dilemma Unemployment Goodness and value theory Isao Takahata Family Guy Strategic management Electronic Arts Determinism The Origin of Species Fair use Infantilism Mediation Cold fusion Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Free will Inflation Mo__ Open source culture She Loves You Scientific method Humphrey Bogart Prices of production Intelligent design Studio Ghibli Citigroup Nausica__ of the Valley of the Wind Justification (theology) Poker jargon Productive and unproductive labour W.
