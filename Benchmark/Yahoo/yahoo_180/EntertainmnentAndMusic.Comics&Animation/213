what do you think of my character well she's about as tall as sasuke she is she has purple eyes perfectly tanned skin and long lack hair as for race she's egyption she's a natural leader and will be willling to give up her life in order to save her friends but she has no family her father was killed in front of her on her birthday and she is now an avenger sasuke moment people only recognize her as her fathers daughter and not by her name so do you like it i put her in all my stories but i haven't put them on fanfiction yet cause i'm still working on them alright for the fellow who wants more sadness i'll add on she's cursed with an evil deamon inside of her it threatens to come out every day she now uses the deamon to her advanatage by using it's powers to kill her oponent when in battle she can't luv no one cause her mother put a spell on her that would make every guy she liked hate her the reason she did that was cause she didn't get the son that she wanted and she only got a girl so she took out all her anger on her as a child but the father never found out about the beatings they both died when she was a year old there is that good enough now i can't come up with a good name for her could anyone suggest one to me but i want one in japanese just tell me what it means in englsih cause i'm still working on my japanese skills what i couldn't think of anything else that's the only part that's like sasuke if you read my stories which i won't let you her attitude is nothing like sasuke she's happy most of the time and she's pure at heart i don't know about the name though geez no one likes my character can't anybody say something nice about it alot of hard work went in to making this character seeing people critisize it makes me sorta upset i'm tempted to delate her from all my stories i've written about and make a new character so that all you people will be happy geez no one likes my ideas fine be that way thank you to the person who said they liked my ideas for the last fckin time i did not make this character so that she could be the female version of sasuke she doesn't know who the man is she only got a glimsp of his face under his hood he had red eyes and white skin his voice was very cold and quiet the reason the man killed her father was cause he had lost to him once and he wanted to get back at him she is royalty one of my stories has to do with her taking place of father as the ruler in that same story her people did have lots of respect for her well i wanted to make a character that would over come the evil deep inside her you know a good vs evil kind of story thank you for your comments your deffinently going to get best answer if there is no one else who has a good answer i hope it makes sense there is no details about the murderer could the father killed in front of her by a mysterious figure that would be the only way she did not know who exactly the mystery identity of the murderer what is the motive of the murderer why target the father don't tell me the father died protecting the gal because the murderer wants a piece of the gal that will be totally like naruto where is the location and time i tell you some facts ancient egyptians are polygamous one husband a few wives hardly there's orphan cases but suppose to have step mothers maybe some are kind but some are unkind to her if she's a female in the royal bloodline she is well respected by the citizens for being the future queen due to her special status one day to bear the next generation pharaoh how come demons are in this aren't it suppose to be some mummy's curse or something they believe and worship seth and anubis the keeper of the underworld and they are gods of war and destruction demons are mainly mythological beings in christian muslim religions a natural leader and selfless person willing to give up her life for others doesn't match well being a vengeful person a good leader is unprofessional to be driven by personal feelings and motives of vengence that will be selfish contradicts with the selfless personality don't make her an avenger but perhaps she can hope to make the sinner murderer to regret his her sins and willing to repent perhaps you can refer to a main hero lazlo character in suikoden iv where he had been embeded with the rune of punishment a powerful destructive force that can tear down fleets of ships but it gradually consumes the life of the user your character is very similar to that hero Characters of Naruto Uchiha Sasuke Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Theory of conduct Ten Commandments Evil Uzumaki Naruto
