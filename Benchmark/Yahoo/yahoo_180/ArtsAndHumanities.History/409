how do you feel about the magna carta what is your opinion it depends on which version you mean but none of them are legal documents given the circumstances under which john signed that being said i do have to express my admiration and respect for the barons who among other things proclaimed for all time that haberject would forever be measured at two ells within the selvedge wine and ale would be measured by the london quarter or that if one died in debt to a jew the debt would not accrue interest until the eldest heir came of age and likewise if his estate was insufficient to repay the debt his widow didn't have to pay it methinks the barons were goys or one was exempt from giving more than market value as knight's fees unless compelling circumstances justified more a real stroke for freedom and liberty was the fact that under the charter barons and earls could only be fined by earls and barons but at least no one else had to build a bridge unless he had an obligation already to do so it was really good that magna carte allowed knights serving abroad to skip their castle guard duties cut down on awols tremendously taking the weirs off the medway except along the coast was probably a good thing deforesting was probably something the sierra club would have bristled at but hey the barons didn't want the trees gloria steinem probably didn't like that fact that murder charges couldn't be brought by a woman unless the stiff was her old man it was kind of nice that john got to hang on the the lands that his daddy henry and his big brother richard stole from the welsh but at least llywelyn's son was released it was also pretty swell that all the foreign troops would be sent home after the war was done have you read the charter do you know the context in which it was signed what is one to think of it the barons won and runnymede was their reward they looked out for themselves pretty well as a document of individual freedom and liberty well it isn't and that was not the intent of the baron's who were holding their swords and lances to john's throat it is a specific document which addresses itself to specific issues and while it maintains the fealty of the peerage it also retains the primacy of the crown British monarchy John of England Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus History of the British constitution Theory of conduct Babylonian law First Barons' War United States Constitution Edward I of England History of the Jews in England Richard III of England William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke Wars of the Roses Henry I of England Duke of Norfolk British Royal Family Peerage History of the Peerage Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Coronation of the British monarch Life peer Allodial title Monarchy in Canada Anne of Great Britain Earl of Derby Owain Glynd__r Parliament of the United Kingdom Francis Bacon Plame affair Hereditary peer Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles Szlachta History of Schleswig-Holstein Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Robert Walpole Hercules Robinson, 1st Baron Rosmead Privilege of Peerage Freedom of speech Unreformed House of Commons Courtesy title American individualist anarchism Duke of Hamilton Insurance Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester Llywelyn the Great Baron Tax Edward VIII of the United Kingdom Right Knots Landing Merit Constitution Duke of Somerset United Kingdom corporation tax Separation of church and state George III of the United Kingdom Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Mortgage Bond Ranulph de Gernon, 2nd Earl of Chester Freedom of the press History of Poland (966-1385) Henry VIII of England Richard I of England Edward II of England Robert I of Scotland George IV of the United Kingdom Appeal Frederic Thesiger, 1st Baron Chelmsford Roman Catholic Church John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough History of the Isle of Man Due process Humphrey Bogart Contract William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham Louis XIV of France Usury Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Ten Commandments Constitution of Ireland Intellectual property Charles, Prince of Wales Earl of Albemarle Simone Weil Sampling (music) Second Amendment to the United States Constitution Pretender Roger de Mortimer, 1st Earl of March
