why there were no clearing process by ancient romans after the disaster in pompeii i wonder why the roman emperor didn't sent out troops and workers to clear and rebuilt the city instead of leaving it untouched for century if the mountain kept erupt then why there are people who willing to live there today much the same 'problem' exists on the big island of hawai'i where an on going eruption has forced the abandoment of thousands of acres entire sub dvisions of homes destroyed never to be rebuilt there was pleny of land the population of the earth was low so no one needed to rebuilt pompeii besides it was a grave and who wants to build on a grave well they did but that will cost you another pts the romans merely moved down the coast a ways and built a new city in time that city encroached upon the old city and that is when the old city was dug up mined for its treasures and turned intr a tourist mecca and pompeii was not a 'roman' city it retain many of its own customs and language and thus when it was destroyed the romans didn't weeo in fact pompeii was forgotton becoming legend much like atlantis unlike atlantis it was rediscovered http www mnsu edu emuseum archaeology sites europe pompeii html rome's control over pompeii was distant the city was allowed to retain its own language and culture but was required to admit itself subject to rome without benefiting from the status of roman citizenship pompeii reluctantly accepted this situation for centuries finally when the social war began in b c they saw a chance at freedom and joined forces with other roman allies against the city that oppressed them the rebels and rome fought for two years but one of rome's most brilliant generals sulla eventually defeated the campanians he took pompeii and herculaneum in b c though the allies were defeated they were awarded the status of roman citizenship in order to quell any further uprisings however their former liberties were taken away and rome established colonies of army veterans to help keep the order eventually sulla established the cornelia veneria colony in campania which began the romanization of the region over the years the memory of pompeii and the surrounding cities faded into a vague legend about the lost treasure of la citta the city interest in recovery of the ancient sites did not return until the fourteenth century when the renaissance brought a renewed fascination with all things antique ancient writers such as pliny the younger perotto sannazzaro and dion cassius mentioned pompeii and the disaster that had befallen it tantalizing hints as to what lay beneath the campanian soil were also unearthed based on artifacts discovered by people who lived on the land scholar humanists hypothesized that the ancient objects they found came from the famous la citta excavations did not occur however until the eighteenth century when herculaneum was rediscovered by a peasant digging a well pompeii itself was found during an excavation that began on march from that date on excavations at pompeii have continued sporadically portions of the site remain uncovered and excavation and research teams are still attempting to reveal this mysterious city's secrets peace Mount Vesuvius Roman Republic Archaeology Roman Empire Capua Julius Caesar Troy Ancient Greece Library of Alexandria Naples Heinrich Schliemann Roman Britain Pompey Ancient Egypt Marius Neoclassicism Carthage Atlantis Timeline of ancient Rome Campania History of Slovakia __zmir Lost city Burial Spear of Destiny Military history of the Roman Empire Roman currency Western Roman Empire Lucius Cornelius Sulla Napoleonic Wars Hannibal Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Roman law Palestrina Pliny the Elder Ancient history Byzantine Empire Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II First Punic War War of the Spanish Succession Pliny the Younger Italian Renaissance History of China History of Europe Taranto Stargate SG-1 Antioch, Pisidia Battle of the Teutoburg Forest History of Catalonia Biblical archaeology Mausoleum of Maussollos Franco-Prussian War Property (ownership right) Hellenistic Greece Sylvanus Morley French Revolutionary Wars Franks Oak Island American Revolutionary War Erotic art in Pompeii History of Greek and Roman Egypt Sith Philippi Burma Campaign Temple Mount Mithraism Scythia Past and present anarchist communities History of Denmark Sparta Democracy Hadrian Art in Ancient Greece Military history of France History of Germany Caesar Augustus World War II War of the League of Cambrai Tutankhamun Transformers: Cybertron Holy Roman Empire StarCraft Episode VI Italian unification Deluge (mythology) Bratislava Castle Ur Military history of Japan Cultural Revolution Elam Jamestown, Virginia
