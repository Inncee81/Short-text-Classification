german wwii education this odd question popped into my head a few days ago and now i seriously want to know how do the german's approach thier history in textbooks in reference to world war ii whatever one may say about the germans they are straight people and the allied troops that discovered the camps where shocked so shocked in fact that they created the first tribunal for war crimes in nuremberg in germany till the 's nobody ever talked about hitler but by then the younger generation was asking question and debating what had happened and realized how ugly it had been under mr hitler the greatest con artist probably of all times so i don't know about their history school books but they feel ashamed by what happened especially since it's their parents who made the mistake and the new generation had to suffer they didn't like that and made sure it won't happen again stanley milgram psychologist at yale made an experiment in and wrote a book about it the experiment consisted in punishing students by giving electric shocks for wrong answers the shocks rated from let's say to x x could kill all were volunteer students the punishers went thru the electric shocks so they would know the pain they were inflicting for wrong answers the punished were taught how to scream in pain with each levels of shock since there was no electricity involved and guess what the first student who refused to get higher than the benign punishment and got out of the experiment was a german woman and she told ingram that she had known enough of such stupidity in germany and wasn't ready to start it all over again a colleague of ingram defended the so called torturers at abu ghraib there's an article about this in the n y times dated around wednesday april also there is a difference between historiology and history Milgram experiment Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse Torture The Holocaust World War II Gestapo Schutzstaffel Erich von Manstein Theory of conduct Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Scientology beliefs and practices Polish September Campaign God Emperor of Dune Operation Market Garden Cindy Sheehan Unlawful combatant A Course In Miracles Eastern Front (World War II) Continuation War Milton H.
