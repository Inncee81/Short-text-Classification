why does the coliseum in rome have an elliptical shape why not circle or square i would imagine that the shape of the building was dictated either by the shape of the arena that was required or the shape of nero's artificial lake over which it was built clearly a square building would mean that there were blind spots for the spectators but why an ellipse rather than a circle i can only think that a circle wouldn't be much good for chariots and therefore they decided on an ellipse edit no i don't mean chariot races i don't think these were ever staged at the colosseum i am suggesting that chariots may have been used for some of the mock battles and it wouldn't have been very interesting if they just went round in a circle chariot racing was held at the circus maximus Colosseum Chariot racing Circus Maximus Circus Ellipse Kepler's laws of planetary motion Chariot Planetary orbit Gladiator Nero Astrodynamics Gladiator (2000 film) Madison Square Garden Boudicca Amphitheatre Super ellipse Polarization Hannibal Stadium Roman Empire Sundial Culture of Ancient Rome Wood carving Second Punic War Conic section Domus Aurea Nazi architecture Roman Kingdom Pok__mon XD: Gale of Darkness Via Sacra Arch of Constantine Race track Roman dictator Tarquinius Priscus Roman Emperor Apsis Mobile Fighter G Gundam The nature of God in Western theology Philosophy of language Taikyoku shogi Battle of Alesia Timeline of ancient Rome Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Rome Horse St. Peter's Basilica Maximus Decimus Meridius Keplerian problem Roman Republic Sling (weapon) Orre Verona President's Park Servius Tullius Tiberius Crop circle The Austere Academy St. Louis Rams Dundas Square Poker jargon Maka dai dai shogi Apollo 8 Apollonius of Perga Sun Ancient Olympic Games Caesar Augustus Dai dai shogi Titus Campus Martius Tai shogi Rome: Total War Thomas Cole Ontological argument Firefighter Pontifex Maximus Year of the Four Emperors David Hume Olympic Games Elliptic curve English literature Washington, D.C.
