what was so bad about jimmy carter please be specific as far as that whole iran hostage thing goes the iranian revolution was a result of an american foreign policy that went back to the truman eisenhower era when the democratically elected government of iran was overthrown by reza pahlavi the shah with american and british help every american president up to and including carter supported that tyrant people tend to rise up and overthrow such tyrants opportunistic people communist capitalist and religious often exploit situations like this to seize power neo cons tend to lay the blame entirely at carter feet carter was also blasted by the neo cons as are all democrats for advocating a weak military he was widely criticized for killing the b bomber program he felt and i agree that the long range strategic bomber was an obsolete concept he pushed for and got several new trident submarines built carter was probably one of the smartest and most fundamentally moral and ethical men to ever be president he was also one of the most ineffective during carter's administration we had one of the worst periods of stagflation that modern america has ever had a combination of high unemployment and high inflation carter was also unable to get much of the legislation that his administration backed passed congress and the iran hostage crisis put the last nails in the re election coffin this is his biography http www whitehouse gov history presidents jc html i personally think that carter was a good man with good intentions but he came into washington after the nixon ford administrations on a platform of being an outsider who had no connections to the corruption of the watergate era this was appealing to people who had grown weary of the nixon administration's scandals but unfortunately carter just didn't know how to get things done in the insider's maze that makes up our national government the career bureaucrats and politicians that carter had scorned just ate him and his people alive the carter administration had acquired a reputation for incompetence by the time the iran hostage crisis came along and carter's handling of this situation sealed that reputation Iranian Revolution Iran hostage crisis Democratic Party (United States) Zbigniew Brzezinski Ronald Reagan History of the United States (1980-1988) History of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi Richard Nixon History of the United States Anti-communism U.S. presidential election, 1980 Reagan Administration Mohammed Mossadegh Gerald Ford 1970s Vietnam War Cold War (1962-1991) US health reform under Carter Republican Party (United States) Background history of the September 11, 2001 attacks Pahlavi dynasty Henry Kissinger Paul Wolfowitz The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power George H.
