do you have a favourite poem this is one of mine did you take the trouble to read it elegy written in a country church yard the curfew tolls the knell of parting day the lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea the ploughman homeward plods his weary way and leaves the world to darkness and to me now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight and all the air a solemn stillness holds save where the beetle wheels his droning flight and drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds save that from yonder ivy mantled tower the moping owl does to the moon complain of such as wandering near her secret bower molest her ancient solitary reign beneath those rugged elms that yew tree's shade where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap each in his narrow cell for ever laid the rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep the breezy call of incense breathing morn the swallow twittering from the straw built shed the cock's shrill clarion or the echoing horn no more shall rouse them from their lowly bed for them no more the blazing hearth shall burn or busy housewife ply her evening care no children run to lisp their sire's return or climb his knees the envied kiss to share oft did the harvest to their sickle yield their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke how jocund did they drive their team afield how bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke let not ambition mock their useful toil their homely joys and destiny obscure nor grandeur hear with a disdainful smile the short and simple annals of the poor the boast of heraldry the pomp of power and all that beauty all that wealth e'er gave awaits alike th' inevitable hour the paths of glory lead but to the grave nor you ye proud impute to these the fault if memory o'er their tomb no trophies raise where through the long drawn aisle and fretted vault the pealing anthem swells the note of praise can storied urn or animated bust back to its mansion call the fleeting breath can honour's voice provoke the silent dust or flattery soothe the dull cold ear of death perhaps in this neglected spot is laid some heart once pregnant with celestial fire hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd or waked to ecstasy the living lyre but knowledge to their eyes her ample page rich with the spoils of time did ne'er unroll chill penury repress'd their noble rage and froze the genial current of the soul full many a gem of purest ray serene the dark unfathom'd caves of ocean bear full many a flower is born to blush unseen and waste its sweetness on the desert air some village hampden that with dauntless breast the little tyrant of his fields withstood some mute inglorious milton here may rest some cromwell guiltless of his country's blood th' applause of list'ning senates to command the threats of pain and ruin to despise to scatter plenty o'er a smiling land and read their history in a nation's eyes their lot forbad nor circumscribed alone their growing virtues but their crimes confined forbad to wade through slaughter to a throne and shut the gates of mercy on mankind the struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide to quench the blushes of ingenuous shame or heap the shrine of luxury and pride with incense kindled at the muse's flame far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife their sober wishes never learn'd to stray along the cool sequester'd vale of life they kept the noiseless tenour of their way yet e'en these bones from insult to protect some frail memorial still erected nigh with uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture deck'd implores the passing tribute of a sigh their name their years spelt by th' unletter'd muse the place of fame and elegy supply and many a holy text around she strews that teach the rustic moralist to die for who to dumb forgetfulness a prey this pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd left the warm precincts of the cheerful day nor cast one longing lingering look behind on some fond breast the parting soul relies some pious drops the closing eye requires e'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries e'en in our ashes live their wonted fires for thee who mindful of th' unhonour'd dead dost in these lines their artless tale relate if chance by lonely contemplation led some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate haply some hoary headed swain may say oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn brushing with hasty steps the dews away to meet the sun upon the upland lawn 'there at the foot of yonder nodding beech that wreathes its old fantastic roots so high his listless length at noontide would he stretch and pore upon the brook that babbles by 'hard by yon wood now smiling as in scorn muttering his wayward fancies he would rove now drooping woeful wan like one forlorn or crazed with care or cross'd in hopeless love 'one morn i miss'd him on the custom'd hill along the heath and near his favourite tree another came nor yet beside the rill nor up the lawn nor at the wood was he 'the next with dirges due in sad array slow through the church way path we saw him borne approach and read for thou canst read the lay graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn ' the epitaph here rests his head upon the lap of earth a youth to fortune and to fame unknown fair science frowned not on his humble birth and melacholy marked him for her own large was his bounty and his soul sincere heaven did a recompense as largely send he gave to misery all he had a tear he gained from heaven 'twas all he wish'd a friend no farther seek his merits to disclose or draw his frailties from their dread abode there they alike in trembling hope repose the bosom of his father and his god by thomas gray yahoo has deleted the short name for cockerel in the poem thanx to everyone for sharing yours and for the stars love lady of shallot not so familiar with ulysses but know it a bit love what i know love j newton's amazing grace ncgal you seen the film yet it wasn't letting me put it in the poetry category for some bizarre reason i did read it but as it was a very long poem it turned into browsing which is not a great way of reading poetry i will have to try it another time i will tell my favorite poem lullaby though it is called wynken blynken and nod and was written by eugene field as a child it was my favorite bedtime story my mother read it quite often so often that she can still quote passages plus years later after i gave up that obsession so that gives you a picture of how important it was to me i have also read it to my preschool children though i must admit it is very out of date for children of this age but the rhythm is a timeless beauty Torquato
