what was the view of the death penalty in the th century in brief the death penalty was commonly used for people who were a substantial threat to society murderers and rapists could count on it horse thieves and rustlers could also count on it in many communities however minor crimes like gambling whoring and such were more often punished with exile not killing they ran them out of town after the railroads reached towns it was said they ran them out of town on a rail because the town bought them a railroad ticket and made sure they got on the train local communities were not set up to have long term prisoners if they couldn't sentence them for less than a week the solution was either run them out of town or kill them depending on the severity of their crime the decline of capital punishment came along with the establishment of state and federal prisons the decline of exile as a punishment came about because towns could no longer just export their problems to their neighbors Capital punishment Life imprisonment Rape Capital punishment in the United States Capital punishment in the United Kingdom Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution Crime in Australia Roper v.
