who wishes guy fawkes had succeeded i would hope that nobody living in the modern world would have wanted his success he was a fanatic who wanted a catholic absolute king of england rather than a protestant who had a parliament to guide him my own belief is that success of the gunpowder plot would have led to civil war in england which would have ultimately resulted in a loss for fawkes and his supporters and would probably have led to repression of catholics on a scale previously unknown in england all the exploration and mercantile advances that were accomplished in the jacobean and carolean reigns would not have happened and the enlightenment that allowed the advance of science and engineering would not have occurred when it did if at all even though i follow the catholic faith i am glad that this misguided fanatic failed just as i hope all fanatics everywhere fail in their conspiracies James I of England Guy Fawkes Gunpowder Plot History of the British constitution James II of England Anti-Catholicism Palace of Westminster Philip II of Spain Charles I of England Jews in the Middle Ages British monarchy French Wars of Religion Early Modern France Late Middle Ages Guy Fawkes Night House of Bourbon Confederate Ireland Pacifism Parliament of the United Kingdom Anne of Great Britain History of England William III of England Reactionary Henry VIII of England Separation of church and state Elizabeth I of England Protestant Reformation English Civil War Williamite war in Ireland Mid-nineteenth century Spain Roman Catholic Church Irish Republicanism Mary II of England Wars of the Three Kingdoms French Revolution Anglicanism Joseph Soloveitchik Catholic Church in Great Britain Wars of the Roses Enlightenment Spain Charles II of England Prime Minister of the United Kingdom History of Scotland Religion Polish-Muscovite War (1605-1618) William the Silent Battle of the Boyne History of Germany George I of Great Britain Renaissance Edward VI of England Mary I of England Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford Coup d'__tat George II of Great Britain Age of Enlightenment Foundation of Modern Sweden Scottish Civil War History of Austria Catholicism Jewish Polish history origins to 1600s Irish Rebellion of 1641 Appeal Fundamentalism Emperor Guangwu of Han Henry IV of France Atheism Ancient Greece History of Modern Greece Puritan Oliver Cromwell Henry Grattan Henry Garnet Plantations of Ireland History of Europe History of the Jews in England Mercantilism History of Spain George Fox Technocracy (World of Darkness) Mary I of Scotland War United States religious history German Empire War of the Spanish Succession Scotland Third English Civil War Jewish views of religious pluralism Lewes Henry VI of England Robert I of Scotland History of Poland (1795-1918) Fireworks Transhumanism Thomas More Maximilien Robespierre Succession to the British Throne
