according to john locke what is the purpose of government john locke is a very complicated philosopher and you should not rely upon a forum like this for any kind of complete answer this quote is from wikpedia where you should go for more details it is much too long to write here representative government it is a misconception that locke and his social contract demanded a democracy rather locke felt that a legitimate contract could exist between citizens and monarchies or oligarchies his ideas heavily influenced however both the american and french revolutions his notions of people's rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both revolutions edit right of revolution locke believed that the relationship between the state and its citizens took the form of a 'contract ' whereby the governed agreed to surrender certain freedoms they enjoyed under the state of nature in exchange for the order and protection provided by a state exercised according to the rule of law however if the state oversteps its limits and begins to exercise arbitrary power it forfeits its 'side' of the contract and thus the contract becomes void the citizens not only have the right to overthrow the state but are indeed morally compelled to revolt and replace it a secondary view on locke's position of revolution argues that locke requires that the legislative power must be dissolved not by the actions of the common people which effectively puts people back into the state of nature this view would not suggest that people have the right to revolt but rather to resist an arbitrary power to dissolve itself in order to make way for a new political structure Liberalism Civil rights Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Democracy American individualist anarchism Political philosophy State Two Treatises of Government Republicanism John Locke Social justice Separation of church and state Age of Enlightenment Libertarianism Politics of Canada Republic Constitution Social contract Coercion American Revolution Conservatism United States Constitution Constitution of the United Kingdom Constitutional monarchy Human rights American Conservatism Freedom of the press Treaty Objectivist philosophy Victor Cousin Freedom of speech Free trade Government Government of France Soviet Union Roe v.
