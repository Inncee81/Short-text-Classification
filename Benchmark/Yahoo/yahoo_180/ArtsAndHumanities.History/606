i just came up with a theory im not racist but i was thinking what if when they freed the slaves there were some slave owners that didnt tell the slaves and kept them as if nothing happened they had them working and breeding to this day and the slaves just think thats the way it is do you think thats possible if it is what do you think would happen if the slaveholder got caught if the hypothetical slaveowners are careful to never expose their slaves to tv radio flyers with pictures of liberated happy african americans or any other media not to mention people that could raise the slaves' suspicions then possibly and that's a big if then there's the problem of breeding the slaves marriages with relatives which is bound to happen due to the number of people we're talking about which is extremely small usually result in genetically defective offspring according to some this is happening in some religious communities the amish already where inbreeding as a consequence of cousins marrying cousins occurs naturally if the slaves are sickly and weak they can't do much work and are thus unprofitable then it wouldn't make much sense to keep the slaves would it additionally the slaveowners we're talking about have to be able to ensure that nobody finds out and that nobody tattles to the authorities or has any reason to i e if one of them gets angry at the other and wants revenge and if the world ever found out there'd be a huge uproar the african american community among others would demand severe consequences if not a hefty fine for the owner then community service and or prison for many many years frankly none of this is ever likely to happen in the context you have described it's not worth all that trouble to keep slaves for the exclusive purpose of say cotton picking do they still do that by hand though that's not to say that slavery does not exist anymore to this day human rights organizations are battling slavery most identifiable in the form of the sex trade wage slaves or people who work for next to nothing exist in even greater numbers when you think about quality of life and the number of people who are still sunk in the depths of abject poverty and this happens in north america too you realize that there's a lot of problems out there that still need to be fixed we've gotten pretty far but there's still a long way to go Slavery Theory of conduct Abortion debate American individualist anarchism The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Uncle Tom's Cabin African American Two Treatises of Government Abolitionism Incest Capitalism Social justice Dog Sexual slavery Causality Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Theodicy Capital accumulation Microeconomics History of the Southern United States Human rights Southern United States Babylonian law Property (ownership right) Democracy Species Sexual orientation African slave trade Origins of the American Civil War Public-key cryptography Utilitarianism Economy of Africa Inflation Debugging Human sexual behavior Anarchism and capitalism Exploitation Thomas Jefferson Fair use EastEnders Grimke Sisters Free trade Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette Plant breeding African American culture Simone Weil Labor theory of value Polygamy Mixed-breed dog Zambo Crittenden Compromise Marriage Ecology Reproduction Inbreeding Intellectual property African American literature Atlantic slave trade Supply and demand Nation of Islam African American Vernacular English Family name Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Athenian democracy Homosexuality and Christianity Surplus product Colonial America Androgen insensitivity syndrome Human Civil rights Nature versus nurture Minimum wage Racism in the United States Rastafari movement Slave narrative Amish Empire of Brazil Miss Saigon Avenue Q Immigration to the United States Unemployment Gravity Exchange value Morrill tariff Bah__'__ Faith and Science Poker jargon Afro-Latin American Hearing impairment Dred Scott v.
