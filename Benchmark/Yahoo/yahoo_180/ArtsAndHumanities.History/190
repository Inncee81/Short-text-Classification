did the americans really help out the israel druing the war some had rumored that there were american pilots who flied the israelites' planes etc etc no americans did not fly israeli planes nor did they provide any military assistance israeli planes at the time were not even us manufacture they were french the arabs claimed america was helping israel because it was the only way to save face in light of israel's overwhelming victory israeli intelligence taped a conversation between nasser and king hussein in which nasser asks will we say that the us and britain are attacking or just the united states later in the conversation he says by god i will make an announcement and you will make an announcement that american and british airplanes are taking part against us from aircraft carriers from oren's six days of war p the israelis provided the tape to pres johnson who was furious and referred to the arab claims as the big lie the us did not begin providing military aid to israel until after the war in israeli planes were french their tanks were french british and some us ww surplus rifles were israeli before the outbreak of war the us and other western countries tried to support a diplomatic solution to the crisis which began when nasser moved his troops into the sinai demilitarized since expelled un observers and closed the red sea to israeli shipping the us supported freedom of navigation and there was discussion of western nations challenging nasser's blockade but no one wanted to risk it the us and france promised to support israel's right of navigation as part of the israeli withdrawal from sinai after the suez crisis in ' the west's failure to stick by those promises was disappointing to the israelis to say the least and is one example of why they are reluctant to have others responsible for their defense interestingly soviet pilots did fly for egypt in the war of attrition the israelis shot of them down which ultimately led to a cease fire before the situation resulted in superpower confrontation those who say the us sent weapons may be thinking of the yom kippur war when nixon arranged a massive airlift of weapons to match what the soviets were giving the arabs as far as i know the only time us military personnel have directly engaged in israeli defense was during the gulf war when americans operated the patriot anti missile systems History of Israel Israel Defense Forces USS Liberty incident Gamal Abdel Nasser Israeli-Palestinian conflict timeline Sinai Peninsula Gulf War Camp David Accords (1978) Al-Aqsa Intifada USS America (CV-66) Timeline of Jewish history History of Modern Egypt Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Saddam Hussein The Crossing Terrorism against Israel 1982 Lebanon War Ariel Sharon Black September in Jordan Military history of the United States Yasser Arafat Royal Air Force World War II Polish September Campaign James R.
