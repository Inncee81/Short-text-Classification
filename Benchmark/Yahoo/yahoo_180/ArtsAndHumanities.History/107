who was more cruel vlad the impaler or hitler you see vlad the impaler used to impale his enemies by sticking long polls up their asses or through their chests and left them hanging he also had the breasts of women cut off and their sexual organs removed he also would dine next to his enemies that were impaled dip his bread in their blood and slurp it down it was cruel what he did but it can be understood that he was doing this against his enemies and anyone that stood against him and threatened his power now hitler on the other hand had his enemies executed by gas or shooting or even torture but all that seems to be more humane it is true that hitler had more people killed than vlad the impaler but not in the same sadistic manner personally i think vlad the impaler was not cruel or insane but rather justified in his actions hitler on the other hand was insane and in no possible way justified in any of his actions so who was more cruel vlad the impaler or hitler as usual most of the stories of historical figures are distorted by time and half truths contrary to popular belief vlad the impaler never dined next to the corpses of his enemies nor did he ingest their blood he was the ruler of one of the smallest countries in europe at the time and therefor had one of the smallest armies wallachia vlad's kingdom no it wasn't transylvania was right along the turkish border the turks who spent hundreds of years trying to expand their territory into europe had one of the largest armies of the time vlad's only hope for survival and the survival of his country was to go all out to frighten his enemies he would line the roads that the invading armies would have to travel with impaled prisoners from their previous attacks sometime thousands of them to make matters worse for him just as the turks were backing off a little the hungarians starting attacking him the cruelty of vlad the impaler or vlad tepes or vlad dracula although greatly exaggerated was certainly justified and necessary hitler's actions can only be attributed to irrational hatred and as you've said insanity Dracula Wallachia Romania in the Middle Ages Bram Stoker The Holocaust Moldavian Magnate Wars Vlad II Dracul Torture Matthias Corvinus of Hungary The Historian Impalement Rise of the Ottoman Empire Ravenloft domains Siege of Vienna Erzs__bet B__thory Vampire Green Goblin First Crusade Winter War Capital punishment Hungary Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Assassination World War I Eastern Front (World War II) History of Hungary Alucard (Hellsing) Romania during World War II Max Payne Serial killer Dracula (Castlevania) Battle of Vaslui Battle of France Bucharest World War II Continuation War Landing at Anzac Cove BloodRayne Murder Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Kain (Legacy of Kain) Eastern Question Chu-Han contention Castlevania: Harmony of Dissonance European Theatre of World War II Jehovah's Witnesses Mein Kampf Religion Legacy of Kain Human rights in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq Thirty Years' War __tefan cel Mare Prince Edmund (Blackadder) Battle of Stalingrad Mongol Empire Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Operation Barbarossa Christianity History of Romania Castlevania: Symphony of the Night Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Romanians EastEnders Sin City Theodicy Napoleonic Wars NetHack Yugoslavia Crusade Second Crusade Aurangzeb Gestapo Vampire fiction SS Division Totenkopf Appeasement Gibbet Western betrayal Amnesty International Third Battle of Panipat Bram Stoker's Dracula Kurdish people Orhan I Sheikh Abdullah History of Bosnia and Herzegovina Special Air Service Theory of conduct Persian Empire
