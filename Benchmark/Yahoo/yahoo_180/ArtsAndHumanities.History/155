enlightenment vs northern renaissance what are some differences between the cultural values of the enlightenment and the cultural values of the northern renaissance th century i know this seems like hw but it really isnt an assignment its just that my teacher keeps mentioning that there were many cultural differences and i have a feeling she is hinting that it might be on our next test or something n e help will be greatly appreciated any useless answers such as read the book or do your own home work will be flaged thanks research it jk well not really kidding but i do give you real answer too after all you will be reading all of the answers and doing some work my real answer first off the northern renaissance was all about religion and art the enlightenment was all about politics and literature i'll expand on this a little later secondly the northern renaissance was centered in germany while paris was home to the enlightenment the northern renaissance was still in the middle not dark ages this meant that scholarly work was done in latin and modeled on the classics of greek and rome the enlightenment was the s which meant that thinkers wrote in the vernacular and developed their own models this difference also reflects a different target audience for their thoughts the nr was for the scholars and the e's target audience was everyone the nr was funded by patrons of the arts nobility and the e was funded by the people now getting back to the first thing i mentioned during the nr everyone was catholic or being tortured to death as a heretic the nr reformers did not overstep the lines and were able to enjoy government support for the whole nr in retrospect after martin luther the church would start condemning the nr but at the time it was fine with the proposals the lead thinker of the nr was desidarius erasmus a religious scholar who wrote about religion the main artist was durrer a religious artist who did etchings about religion praying hands is his most famous work and is a drawing but most of his works were etchings the e was intellectually led by voltaire an agnostic type phylosophe who wrote political outcry that was started as an outcry against torture other names worth mentioning a diderot who compiled the encyclopedia so that common people could easily access and research a large variety of knowledge and rousseau whose name is misspelled here who wrote novels like emile about education and relationships his books were pretty much the chick flicks of the day the enlightenment did not really enjoy all that much approval by many governments although a few enlightened despots like catherine the great in russia were enthusiastic about it however the french crown wanted to make paris the cultural capital of the world and therefore pretty much turned a blind eye to the e but occasionally exiled a few of its leaders an interesting tidbit that doesn't go along that well with the question is that both eras produced some works that were completely intolerable to the governments so during the nr scholars used the one main illegal circulation of literature to be able to send out heretical ideas they wrote pornos and inserted their philosophies and research into them during the enlightenment people just went to a neighboring country published anonymously there and smuggled their work back into their original country finally the enlightenment produced a culture of its own that was based on the ideas of individual freedoms universal writes and love of education a comparative culture doesn't really exist for the nr hope this helps Liberalism Dark Ages Jean-Jacques Rousseau Republicanism Protestant Reformation History of the English Bible Judaism Republic Religion Religious pluralism Biblical canon History of literature Christianity Philipp Melanchthon Bible Rudolf Steiner Sociocultural evolution Meaning of life Humanism Rhetoric History of science Education Academia Erasmus Thomas More Taoism History of Europe Late Middle Ages Anti-intellectualism Philosophy Gnosticism Protestantism Catherine II of Russia Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel Karl Marx Confucianism Jews in the Middle Ages Postmodernism Orientalism Vulgate Open access Intelligent design movement Separation of church and state Ludwig Wittgenstein Christian apologetics Atheism Culture of Lithuania Michel Foucault History of philosophy Rudolf Hermann Lotze A Course In Miracles Novel Apocrypha Contributions to liberal theory English literature Encyclopedia Feminism Predestination Martin Luther French literature of the 17th century Creationism John Wycliffe Plato Deconstruction Antonio Gramsci Middle Ages Byzantine Empire C.
