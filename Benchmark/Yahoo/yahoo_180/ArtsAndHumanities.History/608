what kind of man was william tecumseh sherman since he used scorched earth policies and total war against the south i get the idea that he was rough and maybe a cold person that understood war could only be grueling for everyone on every side so what kind of person was he i dont have the history channel sherman was full of contradictions he spent a good deal of time in deep south he was president of what became lsu he actually sympathized with the complaints of southerners in their disputes with the federal government he was prone to depression and had to go home for rest to recover his men loved him called him uncle will his campaign to destroy the will to fight by ripping georgia was brutal but very effective his strategy was also brilliant the confederates tried to hold him back by doing such things a blowing up tunnels and bridges on the railroads they thought they had held him out of atlanta by these tactics not long after the southerners arrived in atlanta and they expected some rest they heard a trail whistle one soldier was exasperated he said sherman carries extra tunnels with him he was simply as soldier who was told to win and he did he also saved abraham lincoln in the election of news of the fall of atlanta came just before the election and probably made the difference in the election if lincoln had lost then the presidency would have gone over to the dems who were prepared to negotiate peace William Tecumseh Sherman Atlanta Campaign Abraham Lincoln Vicksburg Campaign Ulysses S.
