a jfk avengement could be given now that it is clear whom assasinated him and rfk and dr king would it be morally right to do this from the streets eye an eye since our own govt won't pursue these selfish murderers and that means anyone still connected to them today understanding most of them are either dead or too old to do anything but wait while they worry what their fate is for committing the act o k what if their club still exists now there mr buddy rabbit would it be morally right interesting there marguerite and i wouldn't argue with a scholar at least not today though i will say that those affected by the late jfk's words are admirers of hope and faith for a system that has been failing u s since his assasination and the obvious secret societies existing are possibly bringing the country into a dark age filled with greed and disharmony i am beginning to believe the only thing that will bring those people to our level is the idea that their fate is no different than our own so to be or not to be if that is the question what is the answer it is well known who is responsible all the info is at the touch of a keyboard some outlandish most true from hunt to rockafellr and then some it's all highly understandable with all the info available when it comes to those abusing the rights and power handed down by our ancestors whom fought for this land i do advocate vigilante justice against those that try to undermine it it seems there is no other justice since the rich run the judicial system leaving aside the wild conspiracy theories it seems likely that the assassination of jfk was a mob hit the man who actually did it died a couple of years ago in prison in france however which individual s actually ordered it is not known and it is likely that he they are deceased at this point regardless of who the victim was what you are advocating is vigilante justice this exists in the middle east on a large scale suicide bombings car bombs outside restaurants etc and in the inner cities of most major cities in the form of gang wars and the result is unrest and distress for the whole social spectrum whether personally involved or not the mark of civilized societies is that people do not take the law into their own hands but have a legal process that must be followed admittedly it sometimes fails but it is still a much better system than the upheaval that follows as a result of the self righteous gunning down the perceived perpetrator in the street if jfk was the person his worshippers seem to believe i would think vigilante justice is the not what he would want Assassination Theory of conduct Capital punishment Murder Goodness and value theory Coercion Rape Same-sex marriage Civil rights Democracy Classified information Social justice Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Religion Government of India Altruism Liberalism Theodicy Ethics Sexual orientation Christianity Evil Abortion debate Fathers' rights Meme Consensual crime Paul of Tarsus Cultural relativism Objectivist philosophy Blue Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Left-wing politics State Yusuf al-Qaradawi Summa Theologiae Freedom of speech Scientology beliefs and practices Lynching in the United States Non-aggression principle Noam Chomsky Terrorism Robert F.
