what did the south think would happen to the western territories they seceded from the union if there had been no war and they had been allowed to secede did they plan on claiming some of the land in the west or would the have been content with what existed in the seceding states did anyone even think about it at the time did the south know that the north would fight a war to preserve the union well it was the reality of the western lands that prompted the crisis in the first place the south had worked the constitutional convention and made sure that any treaty required majority vote in the senate if you look at the original states that means to block a majority also known as a super majority all the south needed was states to vote against a treaty how many slave holding states were there at the time south carolina georgia north carolina virginia maryland thus the south could block any trade treaty that threatened the economic viability of the plantation slavery system when new states came into the union starting with the louisiana purchase the balance of slave states to free states must remain or the south was in danger of losing their ability to block a treaty in the senate now couple this reality with the fact that the plantation system had reached its geographic limits and you have a real problem if you are a pro slavery southern person there is no reason for any of the new western states to be slave states since the plantation system will not work in their type of geography so any new state made from the west will only be slave states because the south forces it to be a slave state they cannot rely on these forced slave states to vote in the solid block necessary to stop anti slavery trade treaties thus the south did not want anything to do the future movement west they neither wanted or cared what happened to the western provinces after they succeeded since they would not naturally be slave territories and part of the plantation system remember slavery was a means to an economic end the plantation system even if kansas was a slave state they could never be part of the plantation system and thus would be an unwanted appendage on the confederate states of america had they won the war as for the last part did the south think the north would fight the leaders thought it likely that the north would make a show of force but they never believed that the north would expend much blood and treasure over the battle remember the states rights arguments were about the right to have slaves they never believed that there was enough passion in the north to fight a bloody war to free the slaves in fact lincoln stayed far away from that rhetoric himself he called it a war to preserve the union and only after the north was fully committed the war effort did he break out the emancipation proclamation and change the moral tenor of the war rhetoric hope this helps good luck Slavery Emancipation Proclamation Slave state Southern United States Border states (Civil War) Origins of the American Civil War United States History of the United States History of the United States Constitution Midwestern United States History of the United States (1789-1849) United States Senate Robert E.
