what was the war truly about between the north and south dont be fooled they wanted one ceri ance money people then the slaves so maney ran north thats when they said it must end all slavery witch was a good thing for the people if you want the typical yahoo answers thoughtless dubious and undoubtedly wrong answer go with states rights slavery was not an issue lincoln said too many times to count that he would endorse slavery if it would end the war and jeff davis said he would have no problem with abolition if the confederacy was allowed to survive as a collection of independent nations if you are really interested you need to do some reading one hopes you can do that better than you can write start with some of the things the southern statesmen were saying to their northern brethren in when the new england states threatened to secede better still go back to the arguments pro and con of a single strong central government while the states were all independent nations under the articles of confederation during the drafting of the constitution and apply those thoughts to and beyond the civil war was a criminally stupid unnecessary bloodletting brought on by arrogant extremists and blundering politicians who could not resolve their differences by diplomatic means on the other hand the civil war was an inevitable consequence of the independence won by the colonies in with the treaty of versailles the southern colonies by all rights should have formed a separate and distinct nation or nations then however the bonds created by the common cause of the recent insurrection spawned a false unity between the colonies which culminated with the ratification of the constitution in and its implementation in the southern states especially virginia could live with detente with the north for the next or decades because most of the positions of power were held by southerners notably virginians as the north expanded westward and northern dollars diminished southern power and position things got more and more dicey until south carolina said enough is enough and pulled out of the union in december it took a few more months for lincoln to get inaugurated and for the shooting to start but once south carolina attempted to secede the north was committed to a fight to the death to keep the upstart states in the fold likewise the southern states having told new england in that they couldn't secede were going to fight to the death for their freedom and independence bear in mind that by in the southern states had more history as independent or quasi independent entities than they had had as a subject unit in a larger whole and couple that with the american spirit of independence an freedom they had thumbed their noses at the most powerful nation on the planet and gotten away with it largely by force of southern arms in the hands of southern troops under direction of southern leaders if king george couldn't beat them the wannabes in the north were sure as heck not going to tell them what they could and couldn't do the north on the other hand didn't want a potential enemy on its southern border who might ally with france or britain in an effort by the europeans to reclaim some of their lost ground in the mississippi basin and the north didn't want competition with its conquest of the west several western northern and border states would have joined in the confederate cause but geography and proximity to northern troops convinced them that discretion might better prevail the mentality of the war is nicely summed up by the case of robert e lee his views on slavery were not too dissimilar from lincoln's and he viewed his slaves as better off on his plantation than they would be in africa lincoln actually carried it a little further and said that as long as there were two races the weaker as a basic fact of life would be subjugated by the stronger lee opposed the secession of virginia from the union but he turned down command of the union army out of loyalty to virginia therein lies the basic difference between north and south and the simplified leading cause of the war southerners considered themselves citizens of their state while northerners and westerners thought of themselves as americans first that would be a product of the mobility of the industrial and mercantile north versus the multi generational residence of the southerners on their farms and plantations the world was passing the south by and the confederate oligarchs wanted to maintain an untenable status quo the hoi poloi bought into their rhetoric the north was more concerned with continuing the growth and expansion of a vibrant and virile new nation with aspirations to be an international power the immovable object was going to be hit sometime by the irresistible force the only question was when south carolina answered the question in december the arguments were old and stale in december they had been hashed and rehashed in in in in and in aaron burr tried putting the secessionist arguments into practice in but the virginia militia put down his attempt and arrested him the arguments continued with increasing rancor until the guns were drawn at fort sumter on april eventually after the war the us actually became united states as opposed to being independent states linked together by a piece of paper the pity is that the diplomats actually delayed the start of the war by at least years had it been fought in as it almost was the loss of life and property would have been far less severe the irony is that the southern traitors of were saying the same things that their grandfathers had said in while the northern patriots were disavowing those same treasonous ravings of their grandfathers both the war of and that of were insurrections fought by disloyal subjects against their rightful sovereign over bogus and manufactured grievances the difference is the southerners still believed the rationale of applied in while the northerners said whoa it's okay when we do it but you can't do it to us Unlawful combatant Democratic Party (United States) United States religious history Military history of the United
