what other stories are there that fall in the category of the illiad and the odessey i've read both and i've seen troy which is one of my favorite movies but like i havnt really heard nay more stories about that time or that war or anything what has hollywood missed wikipedia says the events of the trojan war are found in many works of greek literature and depicted in numerous works of greek art there is no single authoritative text which tells the entire events of the war instead the story is assembled from a variety of sources some of which report contradictory versions of the events the most important literary sources are the two epic poems traditionally credited to homer the iliad and the odyssey composed sometime between the ninth and sixth centuries bc each poem narrates only a part of the war the iliad covers a short period in the last year of the siege of troy while the odyssey concerns odysseus's return to his home island of ithaca following the sack of troy other parts of the trojan war were told in the poems of the epic cycle also known as the cyclic epics the kypria aithiopis little iliad iliou persis nostoi and telegony though these poems survive only in fragments their content is known from a summary included in proclus' chrestomathy the authorship of the cyclic epics is uncertain it is generally thought that the poems were written down in the seventh and sixth century bc after the composition of the homeric poems though it is widely believed that they were based on earlier traditions both the homeric epics and the epic cycle take origin from oral tradition even after the composition of the iliad odyssey and the cyclic epics the myths of the trojan war were passed on orally in many genres of poetry and through non poetic storytelling events and details of the story that are only found in later authors may have been passed on through oral tradition and could be as old as the homeric poems visual art such as vase painting was another medium in which myths of the trojan war circulated in later ages playwrights historians and other intellectuals would create works inspired by the trojan war the three great tragedians of athens aeschylus sophocles and euripides wrote many dramas that portray episodes from the trojan war among roman writers the most important is the st century bc poet virgil in book of the aeneid aeneas narrates the sack of troy this section of the poem is thought to rely on material from the cyclic epic iliou persis Sanskrit literature Little Iliad Kypria Trojan Horse Troy (film) Telegony Achilles Poetry French Renaissance literature Modern Greek literature Aeneas Byzantine Literature Bible Anglo-Saxon literature Irish mythology Aithiopis Lost work British literature Ancient Greece Ganymede Agamemnon New Testament Loeb Classical Library Aeschylus Novel Lu__s de Cam__es Short story Arabic literature H.D.
