how did martin luther view copernicus and how long did calvin view copernicus for ap euro summer work this is from the book a world lit only by fire by william manchester for an ap euro class please answer if you are taking ap euro if you're asking what manchester says about luther calvin's view it's been years since i read the book you mention but i'm rather clear he was highly critical of these men but not on a very solid basis in other words he was quick to accept legends and caricatures i recall manchester's views to be something on the order of the popular but patently false claim that columbus's opponents in the church thought the world was flat in fact they all believed it to be spherical only his critics thought it larger than he did in fact they were correct on that point unfortunately some of the main sources quoted on these matters are people who wrote with a strong anti religious bias esp andrew white who helped spread the columbus story without ever checking his facts or those who rely on them e g sadly thomas kuhn the source of the case student's blog entries cited in another answer as for what luther and calvin really thought about copernicus neither of them ever made any official statement about copernicus's theories luther's only comments were offhand remarks made around his dinner table in and recorded variously by his students it's clear copernicus was involved since that very year university of wittenberg mathematics professor georg joachim rheticus went to visit copernicus to learn from him and eventually bring c's major work on the revolutions of the heavenly spheres to press as c was on his deathbed note again the date that is four years before copernicus's magnum opus was published there was some knowledge of his views in the scholarly community but most did not learn much about them until after rheticus's efforts for which he has been dubbed the first copernican copernicus's system was in the mid th century still very short on data it was not until tycho brahe's detailed observations and the work of johannes kepler that the theory could be firmly established newton's work on gravity was also an important ingredient also since copernicus still believed the planetary motions to be circular kepler first argued for elliptical paths his theories were not as simple and clear as what we now know as the copernican system epicycles for example still played an important part i'm posting links to a couple of solid articles one on luther one on calvin that gives you a better idea of what they did and didn't say again neither attempted a scholarly attack on it in particular they did not argue that this view or theories like it would undermine or contradict scripture for that matter when they did speak on the role of science and its connection to scripture they took a very open view and both took the general position that scripture's language about the natural world was phenomenological that is it simply reflected common sense observation how things look from ordinary daily human experience and did not necessarily teach us exactly how the physical world operates modern day example we still speak of sunrise and sunset http www leaderu com science kobe html http www nd edu mdowd postings calvinastrorev html Giordano Bruno Science Creationism Isaac Newton Postmodernism Falsifiability History of physics Physics Occam's Razor Hipparchus (astronomer) Age of Enlightenment Geocentric model Solar system Plame affair History of creationism Scientific method Apocrypha Young Earth creationism Creation-evolution controversy Cosmology Philosophy of mathematics Supernatural Religion Logic Scientific skepticism History of astronomy Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Cultural relativism Philosophy of science New Testament Kepler's laws of planetary motion Quantum mechanics History of astrology Existence of God Protestant Reformation John Wycliffe Philosophy of language Planetary orbit Reality Martin Heidegger Intelligent design movement Biblical canon Causality Scientology beliefs and practices Predestination A Course In Miracles History of Western philosophy Meaning of life Sociocultural evolution Economics Ludwig Wittgenstein Astrology Teach the Controversy Epistemology Deconstruction Determinism Cognitive science General relativity Creation science Mathematics Georg Joachim Rheticus Angel Fundamentalism Atheism Ptolemaic system Social sciences Theory Big Bang Calvinism Black hole Anti-intellectualism Aberration of light Bah__'__ Faith and Science Open access Doomsday argument John Dee Alchemy Protestantism Pseudoscience
