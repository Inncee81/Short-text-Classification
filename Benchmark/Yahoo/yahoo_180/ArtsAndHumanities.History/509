did ronald regan destroy the ussr blind folded with one hand tied behind his back ok here's my opinion on it the soviet union died of the terminal cancer of stalinist communism kruchev put a bandaid on it but brezhnev pulled it off and picked at the scab mikhail gorbachev was the first leader to attempt to really treat it but his reforms were too little too late germans tore down that wall not mr r's passionate speach adecker best so far about the vodka tax another important event that was a big contributor was gorbachev's legalizing the private ownership of photo copying machines prior to that buisnesses and individuals that needed copies made had to stand in line a kgb operatied copy centers as far as struggling to keep up with regan s military buildup as contributing to the fall the soviets struggled to keep up through out the entire cold war they would have continued to keep up even without us having wasted all of that money on b and b bombers the strategic missile submarine made the long range strategic bomber obsolete by the s the russians stopped making them and converted most of their long range tu s to an anti submarine platform they would have continued to keep up even should read they would have struggled to keep up even jimmy carter was reviled by the then flegling noe con movement for killing the b they called hin weak on defence what the media failed to mention was that he invested a lot of the money saved in submarines the wall street journal naming reagan the th best president all time is kind of like me naming my friend adam the bestest friend of all time in other words a little biased after all it was their managing editor in the late s early s who first really popularized supply side voodoo economics and it is them now still hanging on to the idea that george bush knows what he's doing avoiding the argument about reagan it is clear that after the early s the soviet union was in steep decline opec's moves did not only hurt the united states and fighting a war like in afghanistan or somewhere was not exactly cheap as well it was failing and became a sinkhole as well a growing black market and various ethnic struggles some deepening as a result of the invasion of afghanistan or made worse by opposition as homegrown boys were sent there did nothing to help matters reagan's military policies did draw some quivers from the most hardline and paranoid of the russian political leaders but their intelligence was pretty good to say the least so while they never quite understood the united states their military policy was not quite so reactionary as most conservitives make it out to be as well because the soviets were so what's the word for it imperialistic selfish is it that simple they did not endear themselves to supposed allies and they failed miserably to expand economic opportunities for their people limiting them on ideologic and worse bureaucratic issues in the end oddly enough some observors of the soviet scene have noted that the straw that broke the camel's back was an increase in vodka taxes which led to a huge movement away from state produced vodka and toward black market vodka which sucked huge amounts of money out of the soviet coffers at a time when they needed the money most History of Russia Nuclear warfare Leonid Brezhnev Cold War (1962-1991) Democratic Republic of Afghanistan Military history of the Soviet Union Economy of Russia Anti-communism Communism Zbigniew Brzezinski History of the Soviet Union (1953-1985) Democratic Party (United States) History of the United States Supply-side economics Keynesian economics Continuation War Inflation Operation Barbarossa History of communism Sino-Japanese relations Japan-United States relations Mutual assured destruction Winter War Russian Revolution of 1917 Polish-Soviet War Nuclear arms race Communist state Cultural Revolution Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti History of socialism Vietnam War Microeconomics Privatization Japanese-Soviet relations Puppet state Marshall Plan Right-wing politics Perestroika 1980s Media bias in the United States Workers' Party of Korea Economy of the Soviet Union Eastern Front (World War II) Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Second Battle of the Atlantic Politics of Russia History of the United States (1964-1980) Left-wing politics Strategic Defense Initiative Progressive Conservative Party of Canada Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II Appeasement United States embargo against Cuba Capitalism History of nuclear weapons George H.
