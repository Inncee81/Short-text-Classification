is'nt it about time the turks gave constantinople istambul back to greece i mean come on at the end of the crusades they got a foothold for their religion in the baltic countries and eastern europe on top of that the christians gave back the islamic settlements that they had garrisoned do they still even allow christians to practice their religion in istanbul mertev i know it was first roughly uninhabited then helenized by the macedonians then the romans what i meant with my theory was that since greece is essentially the remnants of the eastern roman empire if it were to be returned the country modernly known as greece should inherit it suggestion the writer who comments that istambul was never greek ought to read some pre islamic history constantinople was greek but they knew it as byzantium it's name from the classicasl period until the reign of constantine the great who changed its name to flatter himself i suppose that next you'll be trying to tell me that jerusalem wasn't jewish learn your history before shooting your mouth off Byzantine Empire Constantinople Greece __stanbul History of Greek and Roman Egypt Greeks Ottoman Empire Byzantine art Crusade Fall of Constantinople Icon Manuel I Comnenus History of Europe Ancient Greece Thessaloniki Middle Ages Jerusalem History of Greece Western world Persian Empire Jew Iconoclasm Christianity Roman Empire Separation of church and state Second Crusade Balkans Byzantine architecture Jews in the Middle Ages East-West Schism Khazars History of Islam Sephardi Jews Nicaea Roman and Byzantine Greece History of Christianity Emperor Names of the Greeks Ashkenazi Jews History of Modern Greece Bulgarian Orthodox Church Eastern Orthodox Church History of the Middle East Constantine I (emperor) History of Palestine Viking Age Patriarch of Constantinople History of Buddhism Roman Emperor Saint Nicholas Turkic peoples Religious conversion Ottoman Greece Bosniaks Late Antiquity Macedonia (region) Philosophy Palestinian Filioque clause Europe Jewish history Coptic Christianity Kievan Rus' Cyprus Roman Greece Catholicism Theodosius I Trinity History of early Arab Egypt Corinth Russia Serbia Greek language History of the Roman Catholic Church Kemal Atat__rk Kingdom of Jerusalem Religion in Israel Julian calendar Judaism Sabbath History of the First Bulgarian Empire Justinian I Bulgaria History of West Eurasia Vlad III Dracula Ancient Rome Medieval art Paul of Tarsus Hippodrome of Constantinople
