do you really think slavery is no longer prevalent in modern civilisation or has the method of enslavement just changed i won't offer my own views at this point impressed the bill one more poster and you have come the closest to an important aspect i hoped would be discussed western greed for goods at ridiculously cheap cost to ourselves has led to misery and a starvation level existence for so many and no opportunity to escape this situation as business will be taken to those who put up with it no good saying organisations like the imf support these people either so many strings are tied to money given that donations are often worthess in real terms this is enslavement by stealth totally disagree my view is pessimistic it genuinely is that bad would say i'm being pragmatic many posts have raised valid points about differents methods employed cheers everyone this post is going to be a nitemare to choose best answer for there are so many i like my favourite ones are those that look at the broader perspective of what constitutes slavery enslavement the answers from melody robin straight down the line bletherskyte anarchy bobounumpty marguerite l and dragoner appeal to me very much i think most still think of slavery as the owned slave concept enslavement is really an individual or section of society oppressively depriving others of opportunities and basic rights to facilitate their own advantage we seem to not have made any genuine progress at all in this area just shifted methods and location as some have said many have even found ways to pretty up these horrible practices to make them seem more acceptable but a stinkweed by any other name just stinks i'll try to choose a best answer today not looking forward to it tho i suppose slavery means being forced to work for another without the prospect of changing location by that definition much of the world is enslaved by the western capitalist governments trade agreements that stipulate the goods that can be grown and the rate that will be paid for them what chance does an african cocoa bean grower have of not doing so in real terms true he is technically free to refuse but he and his family and village will die in the process the need to personally own slaves has been superseded and re branded as global capitalism feels nicer don't it Slavery Microeconomics Theory of conduct Economic inequality Capitalism Democracy Labor theory of value Goodness and value theory Economics Simone Weil Inflation Two Treatises of Government African American Anarchism and capitalism Exploitation Reparations for slavery Marriage Affirmative action Civil rights Capital accumulation Primitive accumulation of capital Liberalism Left-wing politics Wealth Gross domestic product Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Free trade Abortion debate Intellectual property History of slavery in the United States Deconstruction Unemployment Property (ownership right) Postmodernity Religion Utilitarianism Tax Libertarianism Law of value Black (people) Social justice Copyleft Human rights Due process Human Postmodernism Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti United States Constitution Politics of the United States Evil Software engineering Famine Consensus decision-making Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Religious Society of Friends MMORPG Poker jargon Article One of the United States Constitution Mediation Racism Sociocultural evolution Libertarian socialism Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Craps Neoliberalism State Constitution Strategic management Ownership Anarcho-primitivism Neville Chamberlain Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Objectivist philosophy Supply and demand Flat tax Modernism Sexual orientation United States Senate The nature of God in Western theology Tonality Reality Intellectual capital Philosophy of language Democratic Party (United States) Economy of Africa Wage slavery Commonwealth of Nations Scientology beliefs and practices Gold standard A Course In Miracles World government FairTax
