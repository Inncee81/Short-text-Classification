what is your reminder when your baby is in the back seat so you do not forget them having read another story of another baby who died because they were forgotten in the back seat in this summer weather and then was found dead i thought of a simple idea as a reminder using a velcro strip through a pacifier we fasten it on the steering wheel to make absolute certain that we would never forget that beloved baby when our minds were elsewhere what do you do our lives are so busy these days it is amazing how we can forget the most important things in our lives you know i don't think the other posters are right i feel very strongly that i could not forget my child in the backseat however i am positive the people that did leave their child in the backseat felt the same way it's obviously not planned you never know how hectic your life is going to be it scares me that everyone on here thinks it can't happen to them and that's probably why it does happen so whereas i would like to say it would never happen that wouldn't stop me from taking precautions Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jon Secada About a Boy Theory of conduct The Amber Spyglass Time Out of Mind Friends History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Charmed Avenue Q Shaggy dog story The Lovely Bones Children of Dune The Family from One End Street Scenes from a Memory Pitaten Father's Day (Doctor Who) Kodocha Derren Brown Infantilism Social rule The Emancipation of Mimi Leo Wyatt Screenwriting Romulus and Remus Blonde on Blonde Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Theodicy StarCraft: Uprising AFI 100 Years series Transactional analysis The nature of God in Western theology Philosophical skepticism EastEnders W.
