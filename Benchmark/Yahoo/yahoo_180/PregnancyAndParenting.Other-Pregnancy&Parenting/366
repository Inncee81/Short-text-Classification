losing the baby weight for baby we're so close we're at weeks and the c section is planned for weeks i'm a natural planner so now i'm preparing recipies and such for the first few months after the baby i'm going to breastfeed as well does anyone have any advice as to how to get back into a healthy routine since my hubby works at weight watchers i get free access to their site and they have a program for lactating women i'm anticipating little exercise other than getting out of bed for the first weeks after the baby especially since i know from experience that i'm going to be exhausted from the baby and still healing from the surgery also breastfeeding will help get the weight off but let's be honest that body just doesn't always bounce back i've only gained pounds thus far so i'm not too concerned about the weight i'm just ready to get my body back any advice would be great i'm not obsessing just ready to have a waist again i should mention that i'm not in any rush to lose inches off my waist line i'm giving myself until july of to fit into a size jean i was a size before this pregnancy i'm also setting up rewards that don't revolve around food like after i lose pounds after the baby weight is gone i'm going to get a haircut after i hit size i'm getting a new hair of cut shoes i've been eyeing my greatest fear is the food i'm thankful to have had not gained pounds yet even though i've been an awful snacker thank god the latest craving has been ice from sonic i should mention that my husband has lost pounds in the past year and i'm really motivated now to get into better shape for my kids especially if we have a daughter i want to start the trend for her that it's okay to healthy without being superthin i would say invest in a good stroller and use it regularly its excellent for baby to be in the air from birth on its stimulating and good for their immune system but mostly its great for your sanity and body i was able to walk about mile weeks after birth having done nothing for four weeks prior and then all those six weeks and about three miles when he was three months but just that walking was soooo great plus the breastfeeding youve only gained pounds you'll probably lose all of it hours after lol lucky you i gained and lost about over night after delivery you'll be fine Breastfeeding Childbirth Urinary incontinence Atkins Nutritional Approach Dieting Weight training Pregnancy Brassiere Guinea pig EastEnders Obesity Super Size Me Folic acid Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bodybuilding Shen Gong Wu Baby transport The Contender (television series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Milk Breech birth Adjustable gastric band Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Yoko Ono Puberty Phaedo Psoriasis Neighbours Boxing Strap-on dildo Premature birth Rod Stewart Coeliac disease Weight Watchers The Ashlee Simpson Show Undergarment Menstrual cycle Clinical depression Babe Ruth Equine conformation Kodocha Cytomegalovirus Dilbert Jennifer Lopez Battle of Kursk The Apprentice 2 New York Giants Alcoholics Anonymous Infant formula Marching band In vitro fertilisation Characters of Lost Obstetrics Sex and the City Days of our Lives The Lovely Bones Anorexia nervosa Elephant Sonic the Hedgehog Dog Caesarean section Fasting Aerial (dance move) Sharon Tate Breast Abortion debate Oasis (band) Condom Kurt Angle Cat Passchendaele Prolactin Infant Tocopherol Journey (band) Prenatal diagnosis Simone Weil Friends Rule of St Benedict Medicine The Beatles discography Fast bowling Volleyball Garfield Charmed Rush Limbaugh Herpes simplex virus Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Henry VIII of England Stomach cancer Dialysis
