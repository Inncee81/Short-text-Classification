ho do i convince my husband that we should have a baby he's and i'm we've dated for five years before getting married and will soon be celebrating our th wedding anniversary he says he wants kids but not yet and he's been saying that since before we got married i've tried calmly talking about it but he just shuts down and says he doesn't want to talk about it it would be wrong for you to force a child on him though while he has every right to refuse i think it is only fair that he give a proper explanation as to why he cannot fulfill your wishes and why he is giving you mixed signals it may be that he is afraid that once there are children he won't be able to have any time for himself or time to be together as a couple that being the case you should reassure him that while children are very important to you your marriage will always have priority perhaps he is feeling insecure about being a good father which is only natural maybe he is afraid of that level of commitment all i can say is that it doesn't take a college degree any father is better than none provided he's not abusive of course if he is not ready now that he's in his 's then waiting a few years isn't going to make much difference you can never really be ready to be a parent sometimes if you think you want something you just have to take the ball and run with it the only antidote here is a little patience i think try not force the issue but at the same time be clear about what your wishes and needs are and do what you can to find out about his good luck w o m b a t Divorce Friends Marriage Good Times EastEnders Fathers' rights Piccolo Junior Saga Laura Schlessinger Knots Landing Same-sex marriage Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Le Malade imaginaire Shaggy dog story Episodes of Lost (Season 2) Theory of conduct Human sexual behavior Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Avenue Q Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Critic God Emperor of Dune Phoebe Halliwell Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
