is having a baby a good idea i'm in my mid twenties and have a yr old i still get along good with her father although we are not together he and i have both talked about wanting another child and i feel as though my daughter is growing up fast and i don't want her to be an only child like i was i really would love to have another child but i don't want be with him and he is aware of that i also don't want to be when i go to my kids graduation i just don't know what to do and on top of everything my dad was diagnosed with a degenertaive disorder and has verbalized how much he would love to have more grandchildren i've been single for over years and can't seem to find anyone to even date i can't imagine meeting someone falling in love getting married and having kids within the next year or has anyone been in this situation or have any good advice i'd be thankful for it well you have years before you'd be at your kid's graduation they will already be years apart which is a lot by the time the baby is two or so ready to really play she will be seven and have outside friends from school baby will be more like a toy and the novelty will wear off my own belief is that you should never bring kids into the world without two loving live in parents i know things don't always work out but why start out with the odds against you you don't need the stress of raising another child with your dad not well he may have that wish but it is completely wrong to have a child to please a grandparent trust that the right man is out there for you if you want another child it is good that you are picky you will know good when you see it don't have a child for any reason other than you and a live in partner want one your child deserves it About a Boy Infantilism Friends Social rule Fathers' rights EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Doug Knots Landing Care Bears The Emancipation of Mimi Hey Jude Kodocha Polyamory The Human Stain The Fairly OddParents Fat Man and Little Boy (Simpsons) One Tree Hill (TV series) Theory of conduct Empire Burlesque Transactional analysis Baby Blues Kelly Clarkson Everwood Rich Mullins Laura Schlessinger Kimi Finster Henry Fonda Cliff Richard American Dad!
