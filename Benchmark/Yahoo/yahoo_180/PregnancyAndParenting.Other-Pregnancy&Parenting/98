does it matter to my kids and yrs that my ex and i are not that friendly with each other we are both great involved parents that have been divorced for yrs we have joint custody so we see each other often the problem is my ex has not gottten over the divorce he left me and can't even look at me in the face at school fuctions kids games ect he will never sit with me so the kids end up running back and forth between us cause they want to be with both of us if i pick the kids up he will never come to the door he just sends them out whenever i call if he sees its me calling he will have the kids answer it he will only talk to me when he has to anytime i have a party for the kids and invite him he alllways has an excuss why he can't come now like i said hes a great dad and he never says anything bad about me to the kids and we never fight infrount of the kids i just wonder if the kids can feel the tension between us and how it will affect them as they get older and more wise of whats going on absolutely kids are naive yes stupid no they can tell that daddy doesn't like being around mommy and i'm sure they wonder why but are conflicted about saying anything about it i think group family counseling is in order if you have to go through the courts to have a judge order it so your ex will attend do so he is avoiding you probably due to his own inner demons what ever the heck they may be and he has to deal w them now before it backfires in his face your children will start to display behavior that may not be the norm for them because it is frustrating or uncomfortable for them Divorce Fathers' rights Infantilism Friends The Fairly OddParents Kyle Broflovski Child custody Saved by the Bell The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Social rule Kodocha Transsexuality Goodness and value theory Fathers' rights movement in the UK Child support Theory of conduct The Jeffersons (South Park) Domestic violence Teachers (film) Jumpstart 3rd Grade Joke Laura Schlessinger Garth Brooks Boston Public 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Maison Ikkoku Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Teen Girl Squad The Catcher in the Rye Transactional analysis Ethics Calvin and Hobbes Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Silent Night, Deadly Night School bus Clinical depression Charmed Mediation One Tree Hill (TV series) Fred Phelps Hikikomori Spy Kids Hey Jude Pitaten Visitation Rocko's Modern Life Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Koopa Kid Internet troll Court system of Canada Futurama (TV series - season 5) The Critic The Brady Bunch Mary Jane Watson Karen Horney Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Parental Alienation Syndrome Shaggy dog story Hell About a Boy Undergrads Stuttering School choice Beavis and Butt-head Polyamory Phoebe Halliwell Narcissism Marriage Cleveland Browns Sluggy Freelance W.I.T.C.H.
