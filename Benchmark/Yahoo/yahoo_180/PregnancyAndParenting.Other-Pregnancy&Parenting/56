what's it like being a single parent what's your experience is it really hard would you do it again know any websites that might give good advice thanks i actually enjoy being a single parent for the past years i was young too it isn't a piece of cake and if i had to do it all over again i wouldn't jump to pick being a single parent but it isn't horrible or the end of the world i found a schedule that worked for me and my kids yr triplets we made sacrifices on both sides and worked together as a family to get things done i went to work while they went to school when i got home i multitasked between doing household chores making dinner making phone calls and helping them with homework i don't know how i did it but i did they were each allowed to do one after school activity and i carpooled with other moms to get them to and from it was stressful at times especially when they were younger trying to get three kids up dressed fed and out the door for school and at night getting homework done getting them fed and showed there were certain activities like school clothing food shopping etc that i wish i had an extra adult to come with me while i took them and sometimes i would take the teenager down the street and she helped me a lot with them i had friends and family close by that helped if i needed it i think if you set your mind to believing you can do this trust your gut feelings about certain things learn the importance of time and to multitask you'll be able to get what needs to be done and do what you want to do the most as a single parent spend time with your kids i would look into the website http www geocities com maryaskmenow askaway html i see some woman is telling people all about it and mary woman from the website is a lot of help best wishes The Fairly OddParents Friends Codename: Kids Next Door Computer multitasking Social rule Kodocha Little Britain Shaggy dog story The Adventures of Pete & Pete W.I.T.C.H.
