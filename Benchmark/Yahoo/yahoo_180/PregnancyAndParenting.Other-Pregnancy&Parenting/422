my children went on vacation with relatives and now i am not happy the grandmother of my children my mother in law decided it would be nice to take my and year old daughters on vacation to spain for week since my children are very close to their grandparents i said it would be fine i was greatful that it would give me a small break and my children would have some time with their grandmother and great aunt before they left i had a long talk with my mother in law about keeping my children safe i am highly paranoid especially after the whole maddie mccann case in portugal when my children got home after the vacation i ended up finding out that my mother in law left them for awhile in the kid's club at the hotel okay there was a babysitter in charge of them but i still freaked out it is a foreign country i don't know this babysitter i was just not happy when i heard this to make matters worse when my oldest daughter got off the plane she was crying when she saw me continued i thought she was just overwhelmed by the whole situation of the busy airport and seeing us etc after i got her in the car and calmed down i was able to talk to her she told me she was crying because she heard her grandmother say to the great aunt that she was so happy that they were home because she wouldn t be able to deal with another week with the kids this made my daughter feel really bad i told her not to worry about it because her mama couldn t deal with minutes without her now i am starting to question myself maybe it wasn t such a good idea to let my children go on vacation with them i m thinking i should be careful about future plans as obviously my mother in law can t deal with my children long term how would you feel in this situation what would you do thanks aahh i feel bad for your daughter that's the worst feeling to know your child's feelings are hurt i would have mixed emotions i would be happy that my girls got to experience going to spain that doesn't happen every day they are quite fortunate on the other hand i would maybe not let them go anywhere again until i made it clear to my mom in law that they were not to be out of her sight that you feel very strongly about that maybe just let her know that your daughter heard what she said about getting away from the kids let her know that it really upset your daughter if she has any feelings at all than she will feel like crap and should apologize to her i think it's important that she explain herself the more uncomfortable she is the better she should watch what she says i just saw a sign that said 'children are like wet cement whatever lands on them leaves an impression' i think that fits here that sucks that she was so upset it may put a strain on their relationship if your daughter lets it eat at her EastEnders Pitaten Knots Landing Fancy Crane Kodocha Charmed Friends Avenue Q Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Social rule About a Boy The Ashlee Simpson Show Neighbours Humphrey Bogart The Fairly OddParents Miss Saigon Grandview, U.S.A.
