what did kids do on lazy summer nights and weekends back in the day i'm talking before internet and computers and ipods and cell phones and gameboys i've been swallowed by a raging sea of electronics and i want to find other ways to spend my time back in the s we would just ride around on our bikes till our parents chased us down after dark and made us come home then we would sneak back out again and run around some more then when we got old enough to drive it was cars us guys would work on our cars all day so we could drive them the next day then they probably would break down again the day after that all the time trying to impress the girls with our ragedy rides we would go to the malls alot of course like kids do today only back then it was gamerooms for video games coin operated video games were popular back then more popular than home games video gamerooms were the place to go to meet girls and for girls to meet guys just go bucks worth of quarters more bucks for food and you could play games all day and hang out with friends and of course sports were a big thing high school sports summer sports such as little league or whatever or just running around riding bikes climbing hills or exploring wooded areas or even abandoned buildings kids today dont play enough sports really i dont see a whole lot different in the things that we did in the s as far as today alot of things are some things arent in ways kids today have more freedom in other ways we had more freedom in my days Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man Computer and video games 11:14 Ed, Edd n Eddy Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle American football About a Boy Kodocha Paintball One Tree Hill (TV series) Married... with Children Video game developer Garfield Super Bowl I Conker's Bad Fur Day PONG The Life and Times of Juniper Lee Silent Night, Deadly Night 1919 World Series Tampa, Florida The Ashlee Simpson Show National Football League University of California, Irvine The Emancipation of Mimi Back to the Future Saved by the Bell Computer and video game genres The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Game Boy Advance Paragliding Drag racing Full Metal Panic?
