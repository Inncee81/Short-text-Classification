is my mother being unreasonable and a huge pack rat or am i wrong my best friend just found out shes pregnant so i was going to give her some of the baby stuff we had around the house left over from my nephew and a half years old now i pulled out this thing that hangs on the side of the crib lights up and plays a little nursery rhyme its for newborns my mother saw it and put it back where it was i saw that today and pulled it back out she saw me with it and said 'you cant give that away we still play with it i said 'mom he's and a half years old you dont think he's too old for it she replied with no plus i paid bucks for that thing im not giving it away he still likes it my mother got that toy from a rummage sale for maybe bucks but shes remembering paying more for it plus the batteries have been dead in it for over a year but somehow they still love to pull it out and listen to it she got really mad that i wanted to give it away and said she was being a pack rat what do you think my nephew will pull it out and dink around with it once in a great great while but thats because he sees it if he didn't see it anymore he wouldn't miss it at all plus my mother was just complaining that we dont have any 'age appropriate toys for him but when i try to get rid of something thats years too young for him she pitches a fit if she hadn't seen it laying out she wouldn't have even known it was gone just leave her be you may see no reason for it but she probably does my mom finally got rid of a lot of her kid and baby things even though she didn't really want to but regretted a lot of it when i had my child there are a lot of things she wishes now she kept but they are gone maybe your mom just likes still having baby stuff around i know how it is my daughter just turned and i miss looking at the baby toy aisles in the store i don't put any of her old toys away because i feel like i'm taking something away from her like she might still play with them some people are just like that go hit some yard sales yourself and find some great things for your friend maybe your mom also just wants to keep things for immediate family Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Friends Knots Landing EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Time Out of Mind Hey Jude Charmed Baby Blues Kimi Finster Shaggy dog story Doug Rent (musical) Married... with Children Grandview, U.S.A.
