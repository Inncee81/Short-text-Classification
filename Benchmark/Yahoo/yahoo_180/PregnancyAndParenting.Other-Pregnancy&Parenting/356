why do girls want to lose their virginity so early in life i'm and i have no intention on losing my virginity anytime in the near future i know that i dont want a baby in high school and i dont want some random disease or the reputation that goes with it please no rude or bitchy comments i just asked a question i dont want to be bitched at i have a fourteen year old daughter and unfortunately she lost her virginity at the age of i was horrified when i asked her why she just said things got out of control and went further than was planned granted she should have never been in a situation where things could have gone that far but she was and it did was she proud of it did she brag to friends no to both she gave up the one thing that was hers and hers alone she did not have to give it to anyone and now she cannot turn back the clock and it is forever gone every story is different as is every reason all i can say to you is hold on to yours it is yours and yours alone and nobody has the right to take it from you unless you are willing to give it i commend you on wanting to wait you are obviously not prone to the pressures that face a lot of young girls today do not stray from your values hold them close and hold them tight they are yours good luck Sharon Tate EastEnders Mary, the mother of Jesus Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Jennifer Lopez Social rule Atomic Kitten Pitaten The Emancipation of Mimi Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Poker jargon Kodocha Full Metal Panic?
