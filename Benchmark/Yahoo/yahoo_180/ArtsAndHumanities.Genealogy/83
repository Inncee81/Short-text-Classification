human dna test i apologize if i'm misusing the terms hispanic or latino a i'm a year old black girl i've often been asked if i'm latina and i never really thought much of it until tonight when my aunt mom and i were looking at photos my aunt has often been asked this question too and my cousin and i have talked about the possibility of us being part dominican on my maternal grandfather's side my grandfather looks very hispanic he doesn't know what his ethnic background truly is because his mother died when he was very young and he doesn't know much about his family anyway i'm just really curious about where i or one of my family members can obtain a dna swab test so we can learn about our geneology um i want to know because i want to know about the side of my family that my grandfather never knew i want to know my true lineage wtf can't a person just be curious what's so wrong with that i knew someone was gonna take it the wrong way thanks for answering the question btw it sounds as though your grandfather is still alive so you can easily obtain a dna sample from him using a mouth swab rubbed against the inside of the cheek your grandfather will have received his y chromosome from his father and he in turn would have received it from his father following up the direct paternal line if you take a y chromosome snp test you can see which 'haplogroup' he is in and with this determine where his y chromosome comes from if you have a theory that his paternal line is of spanish or portuguese origin the test will help to prove or disprove this it is also possible to test his direct maternal line too through his mitochondrial dna mtdna he would have received this mtdna from his mother and her mother and so on again it will tell you which haplogroup he is in for that line and provide a region of origin the mtdna test is not as precise but it will differentiate well between that of african and european origin note that the tests look at direct lines so will miss out other ancestors i had both of mine tested through www dnaheritage com a while ago Genetic genealogy Mitochondrial DNA Indo-Aryan migration Y-chromosomal Aaron Mitochondrial Eve Mulatto Mitochondrial genetics Y-chromosomal Adam Human DNA Berber Genealogy Hispanic Polymerase chain reaction Paternity testing DNA repair Blood type Family name Roma people Domestication of the horse Scientific method Family Single-origin hypothesis Negrito Jat Allan Wilson Biology and sexual orientation Biology Francis Crick Shaggy dog story Chromosome Beta Israel Haplotype Genetic fingerprinting Palestinian Meiosis Jacen Solo Calvin and Hobbes Molecular systematics Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Pitaten Genetics International HapMap Project Species Ashkenazi Jews Demographics of Argentina Bayesian inference Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Validity of human races Prenatal diagnosis X chromosome Cancer Anakin Solo Human genome Tenchi Muyo!
