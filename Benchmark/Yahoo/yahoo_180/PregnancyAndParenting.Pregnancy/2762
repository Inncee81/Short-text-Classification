two pregnancy questions ok ladies i have two questions first is i know it is normal to have discharge while pregnant and i know that a womans discharge changes at different times of the month but here's my question i am now days late and i have a clearish eggwhite discharge when i wipe after peeing is that a sign that i could be pregnant even tho a hpt came back negative or is it that my period is going to come in the next day or so because of that consistency and color of discharge my second question is how many of you out there have been two days late where a hpt came back negative and you actually were pregnant thanks so much i do have tender breasts but not continuously it comes and goes like a faint throbbing also i get very very mild cramps like i think i may get af but haven't yet you could have a positive test right around the time of your period to the person who said you can take a pregnancy test until days later that is incorrect i took a pregnancy test the nd day after my missed period and it came back positive so if you're pregnant miss a period and take the test you could find out my suggestion go ahead and take the test if it comes back positive then you're pregnant at least then you'll know and can start prenatal vitamins now if it comes back negative then wait about a week if you don't start your period and take another one in the meantime you should avoid alcohol and smoking and all that jazz just in case you are pregnant if you get a negative then you might contact your doctor to get a blood test good luck Pregnancy Obstetrics Fertility awareness Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Coeliac disease Psoriasis Cytomegalovirus Prenatal diagnosis Folic acid Pregnancy test Tocopherol Breastfeeding Abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Gonorrhoea Endometriosis Twin Prolactinoma Urinary incontinence HIV test Prostate cancer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Oral contraceptive Roe v.
