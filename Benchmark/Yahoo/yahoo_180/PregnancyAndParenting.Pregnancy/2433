my best friend had an abortion and i'm having a tougher time dealing with it than she is my best friend just had an abortion today weeks into it i am already a pro life person and for my best friend to have one really hurt me but she's still my best friend and i don't hate her for it but i am sitting here crying for her baby that she just aborted and i don't know how to deal with it any advice i'm terribly sorry to hear this i wish i could say something to make this pain go away for you i would suggest writing down how you feel if you think sharing it with your parents would help i think you could talk to them sometimes no matter how old we are it feels good to talk about things that bother us with our mom or dad whichever parent you're closest to emotionally or maybe you just need your friend to tell you why she chose abortion maybe you should talk to her and explain how you feel and listen to her reasons a lot of young women who have abortions just see no way out of a pregnancy they didn't expect there was really nothing you could do to change her mind once she'd made up her mind to have the abortion i think maybe you feel like you failed your friend or her baby i want you to remember one thing though we can always do our best for our friends trying to help them is what makes us friends to them but sometimes even that bond of friendship isn't enough to get your friend to follow our advice you're not to blame for what happened but you can be there for her now and through the years when she has to deal with what she has done by having an abortion women who have abortions almost always regret it and you can be there for her when she finally confronts what she did that is the best thing you can do for her now just stay by her and let you know you care again i am so very sorry you're going through this my best friend's sister had an abortion years ago so did someone from my church both regretted it and even have dreams about the baby over the years and the baby gets older as the years go by you can help her the most by helping her deal with these issues later on right now though your friend just needs to know that you still want to be friends and still will stand beside her it doesn't hurt to have a friend cry on your shoulder take care and i hope you feel better soon serena EastEnders Abortion debate Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten Shaggy dog story Jon Secada One Tree Hill (TV series) Friends Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an God Emperor of Dune Abortion in the United States Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Sharon Tate Knots Landing Breastfeeding Hillary Rodham Clinton Laura Schlessinger W.I.T.C.H.
