having husband in delivery room we are expecting our nd baby soon and my husband prefers not to be in the delivery room the first birth was intense and he did not like being in there some of my friends are giving me a hard time about him wanting to opt out this time what do y'all think personally i would never force someone to be present for the birth even the father my sister thought she wanted to be at my birth but then she got sick and then fainted when things got very painful and difficult for me some people just don't handle being in the delivery room very well some people already know they can't deal with the sight of blood and if they are going to freak out it will put the doctor or midwife and staff on edge and they won't do their job as well your husband is being honest with you and has experience to back it up he does not have to be there with you to know that birth is an amazing thing and that you are a trooper for hundreds of years women have born children without being surrounded by doulas and husbands and friends etc all they need is one good midwife or doctor Childbirth Midwifery Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breech birth Knots Landing Socrates Obstetrics Caesarean section Humphrey Bogart EastEnders Episiotomy Breastfeeding Jam (TV series) Philip J.
