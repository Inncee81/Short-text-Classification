when is the earliest week to determine gender during pregnancy im weeks along and i was curious as to when the earliest possible week was to determine gender through a sonogram or any other tests determining gender through sonogram or ultrasound is just an educated guess its not an exact science and sometimes it can be wrong not too often though they are good at determining the gender by looking at it most practitioners wait until around weeks for the sonogram to determine the sex that way the baby is well formed bigger and its easier to tell the dr can do an amniocentesis as early as weeks to determine the sex but it is generally not recommended because of its risks it is usually recommended to determine if the baby will have a disorder such as down syndrom if there are apparent risks the practitoner generally waits until weeks to do this test it isnt usually used to determine the sex of the child and most wont do it for that reason its unnessasary and invasive and the risks arent worth it to find out the sex of the baby wait until the ultrasound around weeks to find out but know that it isnt accurate although close and only way to know for sure is to wait until he she arrives congrats on the pregnancy Prenatal diagnosis Obstetrics Cephalic disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome Prostate cancer Pregnancy Prenatal care Turner syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Spina bifida Intelligence quotient Human sexual behavior Urinary incontinence Password Breast cancer Breech birth GED Miscarriage Controversies in autism Medical ultrasonography Transsexuality Coeliac disease Human sexuality Condom Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Sex-selective abortion and infanticide Autism Malignant melanoma History of intersex surgery Gonorrhoea HIV Childbirth Stroke Cytomegalovirus Gender identity disorder Sexual differentiation Down syndrome Hypertension Intersexuality In vitro fertilisation Congenital disorder Abortion in the United States Sudden infant death syndrome AIDS Twin Anencephaly Gender Medicine Traumatic brain injury Vanishing twin Haloperidol Irritable bowel syndrome Folic acid Stillbirth Biology and sexual orientation Reparative therapy Safe sex Hypoglycemia Pedophilia DiGeorge syndrome Endometrial cancer Ovarian cyst Grammatical gender Autism epidemic Abortion debate Commercial sexual exploitation of children Infantilism Deep vein thrombosis Extreme Programming Oral sex Polycystic ovary syndrome Neurotypical Cryptorchidism Herpes simplex virus Transgender Sexual intercourse Sexual orientation Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Insurance Fast bowling Gender identity Friends Anal sex Mental retardation Sex education Group A streptococcal infection Sex and intelligence Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Ectopic pregnancy Sexual abstinence Aortic dissection Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder Fertility awareness Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Adoption
