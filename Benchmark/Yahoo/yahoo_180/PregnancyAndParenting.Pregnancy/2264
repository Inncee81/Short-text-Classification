how long before your missed period will a blood test know if your pregnant everyone in my family are saying take a blood test but how long before your missed period will it show up and how is a blood test diferent from a pee test out of all of my friends that have had babies before or that are pregnant now most are saying that they had a period a few weeks into their pregnancies one actually had one right after she ended up positive how can you have a period when your pregnant at the end of july i had a very unusuall period but still a period so do i know have to wait until the end of aug or begining of sep to know the home test i took weeks ago said negative im soo confused i dont think i understand this whole thing very well when you get a positive result has nothing to do with when your period is due there is an assumption that women ovulate days before the start of their next period but this is just an estimation and can vary greatly between individuals and in one women from month to month after ovulation it takes about days for the egg to implant as little as hours after implantation you can get a positive result from a blood test a urine test generally takes about hours to show a positive result depending on the sensitivity so even assuming that you did ovulate days before your period was due some women you could test positive with a urine test as soon as days before your expected period or not until your period is due if you ovulated later it would be longer before you would get a result many women experience bleeding in early pregnancy it isn't really a period but it can have just as much blood as one but generally it is lighter good luck Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Pregnancy test Oral contraceptive Drug test Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Obstetrics Ovulation Urinary incontinence Puberty Twin In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Breastfeeding Polycystic ovary syndrome Cytomegalovirus Prostate cancer Coeliac disease Endometriosis Abortion debate Childbirth Abortion Gonorrhoea Birth control Stroke Diabetes mellitus Prenatal diagnosis Blood type Aortic dissection Marathon (sport) Ovarian cancer Niddah Multiple birth Prolactinoma Insulin Ovarian cyst Doxepin Human chorionic gonadotropin Friends Multiple sclerosis Estrus cycle Psoriasis Infertility Hearing impairment Folic acid Haloperidol Cephalic disorder Spina bifida Gynecologic hemorrhage EastEnders Action potential Graduate school Doomsday argument Diabetic retinopathy Hypoglycemia Heartworm Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Nuclear fallout Caffeine Group A streptococcal infection Housebreaking Ectopic pregnancy Migraine Turner syndrome Tocopherol Premature birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Sharon Tate Lung cancer Progesterone Sexual reproduction Kodocha Human sexual behavior Extreme Programming Lunar phase Flowering plant Sex assignment Lipoid congenital adrenal hyperplasia Humphrey Bogart Pneumonia Paroxetine Endometrium Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Pregnancy fetishism Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Infantilism Maya calendar Ovary Social rule Anemia Ben Johnson (athlete) Hepatitis Episodes of Lost (Season 1)
