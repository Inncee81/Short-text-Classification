down syndrome test what would you do my husband and i have different views hi we have just come back from the doctors my husband came into the appointment with me and my doctor asked if we would like various tests which test for down syndrome i said yes and am very greatful that this is available to us i said however that i don't want to have an amniocentisis as this can cause miscarriage when we left i asked my husband what he thought about the tests and what he would want to do if it came back as high risk he said that if that happened he would want us to have an abortion i am furious i know people have different views on this but i would never have an abortion for that reason ijust want the tests so i can educate myself and prepare if needed i'm now seeing my husband in a different light and so confused has anyone else been in this situation many thanks amy i think your husband is talking from fear and misconception we all would like to have the perfect child but that isn't always the case i am the mom to perfect boys and one of those boys happens to have an extra chromosome were we scared when we first found out you bet but he was our son no matter what yesterday was school registration and pictures my son is in early intervention preschool in our school district when we walked into the building the teachers and staff came up to him and were saying 'hi' and he was passing out hugs to them all everyone loves him and they all enjoy having him in the school my husband kind of felt the same way yours does he thought about abortion in the beginning it is fear talking fear of the unknown fear of bringing a child with special needs into a sometimes harsh world fear of not knowing what to expect but i have to say these past years or so have been a joy i am not going to say they are easy raising any child is never easy when i see the two of them together it is really amazing our son has taught both of us patience and understanding and the love he shows to all is remarkable those gifts i thank god for everyday i also see a husband who is proud of his son and gets so excited when he reaches his milestones but most of all i see a father who loves his son as for the tests well they are just screenings to determine your chances of having a child with ds they are not accurate the only sure way of knowing ahead of time is to have an amnio or a cvs sampling and you stated that you don't want to do that so my opinion is don't bother with the tests why get all worked up about something that is not accurate Shaggy dog story Milton H.
