considering abortion at weeks this is the question i asked yesterday on here http uk answers yahoo com question index ylt aow febdyiderewna zlrzlmbv qid aavlv n cp tp all answers tnu i was appauled at the out cry that followed and hope there will be not repeating of that today i went to my doctor yesterday after posting the question and he told me that the abortion would be performed in weeks using the partial birth method unlike what many women on here said this procedure is very unlikely to bring me to any harm also many women said i was disgusting for wanting an abortion at weeks because loads of women are trying desperately for a baby i'm sorry but that has nothing to do with me or this situation and for those that called me a slut i am married and my husband is the only man i have ever slept with i have just turned what i want to know this time is does my husband have the right to demand the foetal tissue after the treatment for some sick reason he wants to bury it he doesn't know the truth of what is happening i told him the baby was dying and when dead will be removed i want to spare him any heartache because unlike me he loves the foetus as if it were a baby i can't tell him the truth it would kill him in my country a foetus can be aborted at any stage if it is found to have a deformity and upto something weeks if there is no deformity it has the most relaxed laws of any country i don't want to bury the foetus my husband does and i don't want it to be buried that is not the question the fotus will be weeks gestation at the time i go for my treatment hi in our countries abortions can not be allowed this early and so that is what is becoming an issue for me here also i just wanted to say that i do believe your decision is the wrong one a lot of people have cleft lips and it can be sorted out when you see them little eyes looking up at you you will feel a rush of love because it something you created and to end a life just because of this small thing is wasting such a precious life i guess i find it hard you doing this because i lost my baby at weeks pregnant i just had a routine scan which revealed my baby had no heartbeat and i had to have an operation to knock me out whilst they delivered my little boy from me i want my little boy so much and miss him always but i did not yet the chance to feel him kick to hold him in my arms to buy baby things and plan all the names to soak in his baby smell you do and you throwing it all away you becoming shallow on the looks thing please please consider the choices you making also don't go lying to husband this baby is his too and imagine the heartache he would feel to know you aborted his baby due to fact baby just had cleft lip he will be so upset and he may find out as it would be on your notes when you next fall pregnant please don't make this choice the pain in my heart that i carry for my baby isn't something i want to keep having to deal with and i wish my baby was here you can have your little one and you throwing away that chance lx i have edited this to say it sad fact that you trying to create what you class as the 'perfect' baby the one without any blemishes and so on how many babies are you going to abort until you 'pick' one you feel matches the bill hun i so wish i had my little boy right now even if he had one eye or a cleft lip i would still want him because he is mine maybe if you do go through this abortion you should consider ever having children and maybe wait until you grown a little to realise a baby's life is a precious thing did you know all i have of my baby is a scan picture which is now fading away that is the only memory i have of my baby except the love in my heart that scan bought happiness and pain as it was the first time i saw my son but also the last because he had died inside of me after that scan i had to go around and try to 'live' like all the other mothers knowing my baby was dead inside of me and i had to wait till i had the op at hospital it was so horrible i just wanted to die with him he is called matthew meaning gift from god and that what i class him as being i did not want to have him taken and kicked and screamed the nurse had to do a prayer with me and i cried and begged them not to allow me to wake up i want my little boy back and now you doing this is making me cry because i would be cutting off both my arms and legs now to be given the chance to see my little one what a dreadful thing to do to wise you up before making the decision you making have a read over this http www clapa com Knots Landing Abortion Jon Secada Obstetrics Pregnancy Sin City Miss Saigon Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Jam (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Theory of conduct Miscarriage Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Pitaten Intact dilation and extraction The Amber Spyglass One Tree Hill (TV series) Scenes from a Memory Futurama (TV series -
