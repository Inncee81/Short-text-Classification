complete placenta previa how have other dealt i had my week scan yesterday and was told that i have placenta previa the doc said in my case it s unlikely to move as it s completely covering my cervix and lying very flat and level at the bottom of my uterus they re planning on doing another scan at about weeks to see if by some chance it has shifted i was just wondering how other dealt with this i m nervous about the baby s health my health and about my job i work full time and so far i m just on pelvic rest no running jumping or sex but i m worried about the odds of me being put on bed rest before i deliver anyone had similar experience thanks i have partial previa and im just about weeks they will scan me next week to see if it has moved chances are it will move for me but you are past the point it will likely get out of the way pelvic rest is usually recommended unless you have had bleeding if you have bleeding they will probably put you on bed rest go directly to the er if you experience any bleeding you might consider no lifting stairs etc just to be safe if it is still complete previa nearing your due date they will recommend a c section this is because delivery of the placenta first will cause major bleeding and can cause problems for the baby this is all the research i did when they told me good luck i hope it moves for you Childbirth Placenta praevia Obstetrics Breech birth Androgen insensitivity syndrome Abortion Miscarriage Gonorrhoea Stroke Ectopic pregnancy Twin Premature birth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breastfeeding Endometrial cancer Intact dilation and extraction Menstrual cycle Oral sex Sexual reproduction Endometriosis Vaginal bleeding Computed tomography Progesterone Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Fertility awareness Obstetrical hemorrhage Gynaecology Bleed Like Me Infantilism Placental abruption Cervical cancer Equine conformation Orgasm Heinkel He 100 Placenta Radiation therapy The Star Wars Holiday Special 1957 World Series Traumatic brain injury EastEnders Poker jargon Avalanche Sexual intercourse Scientology beliefs and practices Prolactinoma Transsexuality Crew Exploration Vehicle Social rule Baseball Insomnia Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hydatidiform mole Guinea pig Mattress Puberty Stomach cancer Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Birth weight Anal sex Intersex surgery United States Postal Service Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Wound Strap-on dildo Coeliac disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Babe Ruth Basement Heinkel He 112 Toyota Previa Sin City Bleeding Cervix Child sexuality Professional wrestling attacks Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Premature ejaculation Stairway Sleep Partial-birth abortion Knots Landing Psychosis Prenatal care Malignant melanoma Natural Selection (computer game) National Health Service Radar American and British English differences Adult attention-deficit disorder Sex assignment Game programming Daylight saving time Hysterectomy Test plan
