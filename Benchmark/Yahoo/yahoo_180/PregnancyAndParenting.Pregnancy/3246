my girlfriend me had unprotected sex in last month her periods were missed for months we had sex last night and did a home pregnancy after few hours which showed positive i have a doubt if can we do a pregnancy test after haveing sex but she doesn't have any ymptoms of pregnancy her peroids are always quite irregular home pregnancy tests test for a hormone in the woman that is only present when she is pregnant it would not come out positive if that hormone wasn't present whether or not you just had sex if the test came out positive then chances are you need to make a confirmation appointment with a doctor because it sounds like she's pregnant after a pregnancy is confirmed i would suggest making sure she seeks prenatal care also please see about getting her on prenatal vitamins for the folic acid especially as soon as possible just in case folic acid reduces the chance of neural disorders such as spina bifida in the fetus Folic acid Spina bifida Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy Fertility awareness Anencephaly Abortion debate Anemia Androgen insensitivity syndrome Menstrual cycle Miscarriage Birth control Turner syndrome Cephalic disorder Emergency contraception Abortion Twin Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Postpartum depression Transsexuality Coeliac disease Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Breastfeeding Prolactinoma Tocopherol Oral contraceptive Pregnancy test Schizophrenia Primidone Herpes simplex virus Ectopic pregnancy Prostate cancer Endometriosis Infertility Osteoporosis Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Childbirth Roe v.
