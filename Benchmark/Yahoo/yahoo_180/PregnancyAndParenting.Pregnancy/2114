what side effects does meptid have on your baby if used during lobour i'm trying to find out if there is any bad side effects all i can seem to find is that it is like pethadine but with less side effects i can't seem to find any deffinate answers would be grateful for any help or advice thanks my sister had this during her labour some hospitals now use this instead of pethadine as is does not cause sickness in the same way the midwives at the time told her there is the disadvantage that it can make the baby groggy if you have it in your system too near the end of the labour and cause problems with the baby's breathing at first and so they had to make sure that it wore off before the end of the labour my sis had two injections of meptid the first was between cm dilation she dilated at a rate of half a cm per hour it was a long labour and it took about mins to take effect she was really really relieved when it did it really took the edge off the big contractions it wore off by the time she got to cm and she had another injection then but it hardly had any effect i don't know whether this was because it was administered wrongly or because the contractions were just so strong but she said it didn't help at all hope this is useful info i will keep this drug in mind for when i go into labour Asthma Urinary incontinence Breech birth Obstetrics Fuel injection First aid Time dilation Atropine Premature birth Stomach cancer Hypoglycemia Trade union Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Caesarean section Creationist cosmologies Scuba set EastEnders Rebreather Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Intracranial pressure 3-quinuclidinyl benzilate Insulin Methamphetamine Myocardial infarction Decompression sickness Eye contact Methcathinone Breastfeeding Abortion Ben Johnson (athlete) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Immunosuppressive drug Cocaine Thimerosal Pharmaceutical company Midwifery Autonomic nervous system Narcotic Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Margaret Thatcher Sharon Tate Cardiac arrhythmia Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Health insurance Craps LSD What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
