could this be i have had a back ache on and off all day today which is unusual for me i have been having occasional period like cramps and tightening of my abdomen throughout the day also they are not in regular intervals they are sparattic i was dilated to cm a week ago i went to the ob today but she didn't check me for dilation or effacement today she did say that baby's head has not dropped into the birth canal as of yet is this early labor is this something you experienced prior to going into labor do you think sex could help move things along a little with symptoms of this sort i am almost weeks and baby is close to lbs by palpitation this i smy second child i was induced at weeks with my first child i wouldn't worry about your baby's head still being high most second and subsequent pregnancies don't drop like in the first pregnancy usually the baby doesn't drop into the birth canal until you are in labor so this doesn't mean you are far from labor at all it could be tonight that you go into active labor sex will definately help dull pain in your back and cramping is a sign labor maybe close i cannot say i have had personal experience with going into labor on my own as i was induced with my first child and am pregnant with my second child also good luck to you and i am sure labor is not far away Pregnancy Childbirth Miscarriage Abortion debate Menstrual cycle Premature birth Breech birth Intact dilation and extraction Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Breastfeeding Friends Urinary incontinence Fertility awareness Anxiety Endometriosis Abortion in the United States Spina bifida Cephalic disorder Androgen insensitivity syndrome EastEnders Seizure Ectopic pregnancy Knots Landing Turner syndrome Cervix Toxoplasmosis Gonorrhoea Prenatal diagnosis Cytomegalovirus Birth control Sexual reproduction Asthma Child sexual abuse Child sexuality Multiple sclerosis Folic acid Hypoglycemia Psychosis Haloperidol Traumatic brain injury Mental retardation Humphrey Bogart Prostate cancer Diabetic retinopathy Birth weight Partial-birth abortion In vitro fertilisation Glaucoma Twin Melanie Wilkes First aid Adoption Electroconvulsive therapy Sexual intercourse Diazepam Acute pancreatitis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Coeliac disease Abdominal pain Group A streptococcal infection Paroxetine Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Human sexual behavior Laura Schlessinger Sharon Tate Equine conformation Professional wrestling holds Oral contraceptive Dialysis Hillary Rodham Clinton Roe v.
