my nipples hurt really bad does that mean i am pregnant thanks i am almost and half weeks away from being on my period again so i don't know why my nipples hurt this bad am i pregnant thanks oh i had unprotected sex and i also had a lot of clear discharge and i don't know why well you probably can't tell this soon if you are pregnant if your regular period isn't due until and a half more weeks then it is more likely that you are only just now ovulating and therefore even if you do have unprotected sex during this time period it should be at least another week until you feel symptoms if by some slim chance or bad math you are indeed pregnant it is more common to have sore breasts than sore nipples i wouldn't rely on that as a real clue to pregnancy expecially this soon other early indicators may be an increased appetite in the next week or two clumsiness and of course the final indicator a missed period i wouldn't lose any sleep over it until you are actually late then take a home pt to be sure i am thinking you are probably not pregnant based on what you have shared Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Breast AIDS Oral contraceptive Obstetrics Neighbours Nipple Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma EastEnders Infant Miscarriage Big Brother UK series 6 One Tree Hill (TV series) Abortion Puberty Knots Landing Child sexuality Herpes simplex virus Friends Nipple piercing Hepatitis C Urinary incontinence Psoriasis Premature birth Turner syndrome Guinea pig Polycystic ovary syndrome Sex and the City Haloperidol Social rule Pregnancy test Masturbation Bj__rk Hollyoaks Sexual abstinence Folic acid Schizophrenia Drawn Together Body piercing Theory of conduct Doxepin Norway national football team Graves-Basedow disease Pelvic inflammatory disease Equine conformation Cytomegalovirus Oral sex Gonorrhoea Maprotiline Paroxetine Pregnancy fetishism Boston Public Prostate cancer Group A streptococcal infection Ovarian cancer Clinical depression Human sexual behavior Stomach cancer Madonna (entertainer) Birth control Marilyn Monroe Prolactinoma Cephalic disorder Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Nudity John Berryman One Life to Live In vitro fertilisation Running Endometrial cancer The Smoking Room Marsupial Platypus Babe Ruth Traumatic brain injury Orgasm Massage Twin Paul Is Dead Futurama (TV series - season 5) Methotrexate Health issues and the effects of cannabis Antipsychotic Thalidomide Cyanide Pornographic movie Cleveland Browns Abortion debate Infertility Battle of Kursk House Mouse Stroke Ovulation Endometriosis Dieting
