hi has an one used a shop bought baby pre natal heart listening device i was wondering if anyone has bought a baby heart listening device i have seen loads on internet they say you can hear your babies heart beat at weeks i wondered if they do what they say or are they a waste of money hi we bought a prenatal listener last week on line that said you could hear baby from weeks i'm weeks and when we got it actually said you can only hear from the rd trimester all we could hear was the traffic outside but as you're further along than me you might be lucky enough to hear bubba we bought an ultrasound doppler instead and that works like magic just like when you're at the doctors they're more expensive but it has given us peace of mind p s if you do buy a prenatal listener make sure it's quiet and be patient you know babies love to play hard to get good luck with the rest of your pregnancy x Obstetrics Pregnancy Prenatal diagnosis Prenatal care Breech birth Medical ultrasonography Hearing impairment Abortion Midwifery Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Urinary incontinence Grumpy's Three Wishes Intact dilation and extraction Married... with Children Social rule Abortion in Canada Hearing aid Jon Secada Congenital disorder Max Martin Frankie Laine Time Out of Mind Cephalic disorder Frankie Vaughan Sam Cooke Abortion debate Neighbours Rod Stewart The Care Bears Adventure in Wonderland Stroke Jam (TV series) Shot of Love Genetic counseling The Jazz Singer Medical prescription Abortion in the United States Donna Summer The Beatles discography Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Cliff Richard Care Bears Doppler effect Hip hop collaborations Journey (band) Schizophrenia Zeta Phi Beta The Beatles' influence Pre- and perinatal psychology Animal Crossing Traumatic brain injury Rush Limbaugh Ol' Dirty Bastard Past teachings of Prem Rawat AFI 100 Years series The Dalek Invasion of Earth Birth weight Publicly funded medicine Ja Rule DiGeorge syndrome Medicine Glycogen storage disease type I The Battle (TNG episode) Knots Landing Phoebe Buffay's songs Luck Empire Burlesque Childbirth Triple J Hottest 100, 2003 Ultrasound EastEnders Cher (entertainer) John Frusciante Beatles for Sale Androgen insensitivity syndrome Little Britain Mary Wells Tears for Fears Bernice Summerfield Hyperinflation Left-handed Dairy Roxette Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Roe v.
