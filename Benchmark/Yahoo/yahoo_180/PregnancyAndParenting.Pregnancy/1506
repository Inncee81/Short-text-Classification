now a high risk pregnancy and paranoid so recently i've had all sorts of problems with my pregnancy i'm about wks preg and was recently classified high risk for preterm labor it seems i have a highly shortened cervix i was diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis and that has cleared up with some antibiotic but it seems the harshness of the medicine administered via suppository has began to tear apart the mucus plug so that is starting to dislodge they gave me betamethodone sp to mature the baby's lungs a little bit and my doctor said at this point if i go into labor she won't stop it i also had fetal fibernectin sp tests come back positive but the fernings were both negative both test to detect the presence of amniotic fluid there's been no pooling at the cervix and my doc can't find a tear in the sac visually i'm not dilated at all yet my question is now this i recently found a bit of spotting med pink to bright red is this from all the recent pelvics or should i call the hospital ps when i say spotting i mean just that it's not like constant flow or anything and i only noticed it on the tissue not the panties or anything it's really not much and i did just have a pelvic yesterday i did get a second from a non collegue of hers they said the same thing about not stopping labor because of my compromised cervix they don't think it's safe for the baby to stay in there if and when my cervix fails she's already almost five pounds approx and the amnio levels are just a little low for anyone's comfort although they can't confirm a leak with tests doesn't mean the sac hasn't torn and i'm not leaking amnio i know for a fact alot of vaginal stimuation can cause some spotting if your not in pain i would not worry once when i was about weeks i had sex and had some spotting it lasted like hrs and went away however if it doesn't go away after a couple hrs or gets painful call your ob right away i mean if he is going to do nothing to stop labor at this point what can you do but wait anyway but if labor symptoms come call right away good luck to you Obstetrics Abortion Miscarriage Breech birth Pregnancy Premature birth Prostate cancer Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Cervical cancer Gonorrhoea Pneumonia Coeliac disease Cervix Endometriosis Ectopic pregnancy Aortic dissection Breastfeeding Medical analysis of circumcision Stroke Stomach cancer Birth weight Intact dilation and extraction Cytomegalovirus Traumatic brain injury Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cephalic disorder Cystic fibrosis Prenatal diagnosis Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Cancer Endometrial cancer Oral contraceptive Decompression sickness Intravenous therapy Pelvic inflammatory disease Turner syndrome Asthma Diabetic retinopathy Pulmonary embolism Sexual intercourse Menstrual cup HIV test Multiple sclerosis In vitro fertilisation Diabetes mellitus Gynaecology First aid Eye Ovarian cancer Autism Medicine Spina bifida Sickle-cell disease Schizophrenia Amniotic sac Migraine Herpes simplex virus Mesothelioma Equine conformation HIV Tobacco smoking Diving Colorectal cancer Spider Hypertension Tuberculosis Myocardial infarction Malaria Paracetamol Birth control Fecal incontinence Common cold Group A streptococcal infection Chronic fatigue syndrome Tocopherol AIDS Infectious mononucleosis Folic acid Caesarean section Infant respiratory distress syndrome Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Intersex surgery Acute respiratory distress syndrome Clinical depression Penis Strap-on dildo Anal sex Placenta praevia Conjunctivitis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Radiation therapy Acne
