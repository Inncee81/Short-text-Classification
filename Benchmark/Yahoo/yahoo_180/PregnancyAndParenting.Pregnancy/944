to circumcise or not and a couple more questions i have about more days to go before i hit my due date and i've really been trying to give this whole circumcision thing some real thought at first i was all for it but now i'm having some doubts ive asked several of my friends for their adv both mothers and men and the answers have been very varied the moms usually just tell me to do it and the men tell me not to what a surprise we'll my male friend had a good point that in his family they dont do it because his dad was cut too short and now has several problems good point because after all it isnt an exact science and then after all that there's the if i'm going to do it should i wait until he's on a regular feeding schedule because apparently the shock can make you child not eat for a while not only that but i read somewhere that painkillers usually arent an option and that came to me as a complete shock if that were true of my doctor then it really is barbaric i dont know what do u guys think and what was your personal choice did it work out okay or would have changed something both of my sons were circumcised after birth about a day the dr said the longer we waited the more risk of infection and complication circumcision will be always what i woul choose when the man is unable to care for himself as an infant or during a spell of illness complications can arise from an inability to clean the penis well in nursing i have seen uncircumcised penises which have been uncared for and swollen from infection are horrific looking and extremely painful i'm sure that any man faced with that circumstance would choose circumcision anyday if religous preferences don't dictate otherwise best of luck to you congrats will pray for you Circumcision Medical analysis of circumcision Phimosis Penis History of male circumcision Childbirth Brit milah Prostate cancer Circumcision advocacy Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Infant baptism Premature birth Bioethics of neonatal circumcision Female genital cutting Intersex surgery Human sexual behavior Social rule Abortion Cytomegalovirus Foreskin restoration Androgen insensitivity syndrome Cancer Theodicy History of intersex surgery Glans penis Infantilism Gonorrhoea Gay slang John the Baptist Gender role Theory of conduct Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Goodness and value theory Balanitis AIDS Penis enlargement Group A streptococcal infection Strap-on dildo Sex assignment Kodocha Kyle Broflovski Humphrey Bogart Traumatic brain injury HIV Health insurance Jennifer Lopez Hearing impairment Stomach cancer Penile cancer Sexual intercourse Masturbation Pneumonia Orgasm Shaggy dog story Chancroid The Fairly OddParents Hypoglycemia Autism Joke Oral sex Calvin and Hobbes Ethics EastEnders Intersexuality Religious conversion Cindy Sheehan Midwifery Sharia Transsexuality Domestic violence Herpes simplex virus Hypospadias The Contender (television series) The Adventures of Pete & Pete Socrates Infant Charmed Fecal incontinence Phoebe Buffay's songs The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Guinea pig A Course In Miracles American Psycho Cephalic disorder Utilitarianism Toxoplasmosis Church of Christ, Scientist Balanitis xerotica obliterans Karen Horney Whose Line Is It Anyway?
