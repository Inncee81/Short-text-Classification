its me keshia again and i am months pregnant tot hose who doesn't know is it ok for me to constipate like having hardtimes in the toilet i do that a lot it takes me forever and lots of push for a piece of poo to get out mum said its cause i dont drink a lot of water will the pushing and forces affect my baby oh and in my earlier question about sport some one said i could swim where is better in the swiiming pool or sea my mum said no swimming in waves cause its not good for baby so i dont swim at all hey you swimming whether in the sea or the pool is fine as long as the waves aren't too harsh and aren't likely to drag you out of your depth pregnant women are advised to stay in water where they can touch the floor if the water is particularly rough then a pool may be safer who knows you may even have a group time for pregnant women specifically at your local pool lots of public pools have them check it out as for constipation this is also a normal sign of pregnancy and while it is annoying and uncomfortable is most of the time harmless you may need to get some laxatives either in sweet form or liquid form pop down to your local chemist and ask the pharmacist for advice as you're pregnant make sure you read the labels thoroughly i was precribed lactulose which is a liquid form of laxative it tasted horrible but certainly fixed the problem if the above is not going to be possible because of where you are based and facilities being rather limited you may want to try the following drinking plenty of water to keep your body hydrated try avoiding white bread white rice and other foods such as these as they can make your constipation worse eat plenty of fibrous foods ie fresh fruit and vegetables raw or lightly cooked and if possible with the skins left on them eat plenty of whole grain cereals if possible and give dried fruit a try such as raisins prunes apricots or figs aim to get at least g g of fibre in your diet a day and try spreading out your daily meals into six small meals rather than three large ones daily as eating large meals can make you feel even more bloated finally constipation in pregnancy is caused by high levels of certain hormones circulating during pregnancy that can cause the muscles of the bowel to relax which in turn makes you constipated as it makes going to the toilet difficult thankfully constipation calms down over time and eventually your stools return to normal i got all this info from a book called what to expect when you're expecting see if you can order it online it's certainly been worth it for me Urinary incontinence Stomach cancer Breastfeeding Constipation Folic acid Coeliac disease Coffee Dog Hamster Jewish cuisine Cuisine of Denmark Laxative Dieting Vitamin C Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Tofu Crohn's disease Breakfast Little Britain Escherichia coli O157:H7 Nutrition Cuisine of the Philippines Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Anemia Veganism Guinea pig Japanese cuisine Menstrual cup Vegetarianism Social rule Diarrhea EastEnders Swimming Tocopherol Hyperthermia Cereal Korean cuisine French cuisine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Elephant German cuisine Cat Wine Egg (food) Weight training Acne Obstetrics Cuisine of Malaysia Roman eating and drinking Japanese toilet Diving Dumpling Alcoholic beverage Spina bifida Swimming pool Drowning Japanese tea ceremony Colorectal cancer Healthy eating Irritable bowel syndrome Fancy rat Kosher foods Hypoglycemia Toilet humour Cirrhosis Customs and etiquette of Japan Milk Bengali cuisine Russian cuisine Meal Sento Fasting Diving suit Gastroparesis Soup Psoriasis Medical prescription Rice pudding Equine conformation Sewage treatment Omega-3 fatty acid Menstrual cycle Fruit tree propagation Hemorrhoid RuneScape quests
