my boyfriend had a vasectomy but now i'm pregnant how can this happen two years ago my boyfriend got a vasectomy but now i'm pregnant i swear to got i didn't cheat but he doesn't believe me how often does this happen vasectomies are not sometimes it does happen but look at it from his point of view if you were the guy who'd had the vasectomy wouldn't your first thought be that your girl cheated if you found out she was pregnant i know it hurts that he doesn't trust you when you tell him you haven't cheated but it's understandable why he does do some research and show him that these things aren't and he must be one of the few that the vasectomy didn't take then suggest he get a sperm count done at the doctor's office to prove that the vasectomy obviously didn't take i would also tell him that you'll give him a dna test as even more proof when the baby finally gets here i know it'll be hard but he may want to separate until he knows for sure that the baby is his that would probably be the best thing once you prove to him that it is his baby everything should turn out in the end good luck hon and i'm sorry you're stuck in this situation EastEnders Humphrey Bogart Friends Theory of conduct Knots Landing Teen Girl Squad Kodocha Philosophical skepticism Neighbours Piccolo Junior Saga Sterilization (surgical procedure) Jam (TV series) Prostate cancer Something Positive Yu-Gi-Oh! anime, manga or movie only characters Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Maury Time Out of Mind Sharon Tate Boston Public Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex and the City Ron Weasley Pitaten Charles Lee Ray Alois Hitler Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Scientific method In vitro fertilisation Roswell UFO incident Social rule Blood on the Tracks Milton H.
