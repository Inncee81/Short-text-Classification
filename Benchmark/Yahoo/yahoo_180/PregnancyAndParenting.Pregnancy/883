is it the mucus plug ok so i am kind of worried and excited at the same time when i woke up and went to the bathroom and sorry if this grosses anyone out but it's facts i need to say to get my answer and in my pad i found a big glob of what i think is the mucus plug it was sort of yellowish but clear and about a few inches long and about an inch wide and after i used the bathroom more came out and fell into the tiolet and it was about the same size as the one in my pad then when i wiped myself there was some on the tiolet paper could this be my mucus plug or just something else sounds like it but before you get too excited you can lose your mucus plug weeks before you actually go into labor my doctor said it gives no indication of when you'll go into labor which has turned out to be true i lost mine weeks ago and so far no baby Childbirth Tire Cervix Mathematician One-time pad The Empty Child Strap-on dildo Wood The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Bad Wolf Mucus Menstrual cycle Kimberly-Clark Corporation Toilet paper EastEnders Paper size The Shining (film) Surplus value Stomach cancer Minor Harry Potter Beasts Shaggy dog story Toilet humour Coeliac disease Mattress Tic-Tac-Dough Rei Ayanami Diamond Japanese toilet Tobacco Avenue Q TARDIS Good Times Bidet Menstrual cup Violin Sin City Horsepower Model aircraft The Lovely Bones Reading spark plugs for racing Law of value Jack plug Unemployment Canon (fiction) Bloody Stupid Johnson Battle of Jutland Australian legislative election, 2004 Public-key cryptography Opportunity rover Asthma USS Tunny (SS-282) Membrane potential Knots Landing Elvis Presley Big Brother (USA TV series) Piccolo Junior Saga Thermal power station Spark plug Toilet Medical prescription The Family from One End Street Urinary incontinence Laptop Gross domestic product Ron Weasley New York Giants Australian electoral system Wheel of Fortune Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Colorectal cancer Ron and Fez Human penis size Russian joke Timpani Fecal incontinence Aliens vs. Predator 2 Kibbutz Naval mine Plasma display Personal computer Brassiere Douglas Adams House of M Baroque chess Bringing It All Back Home HIV Cultural relativism Ocean's Twelve StarCraft Episode VI Elephant Fertility awareness Identity Crisis (comics) African American Vernacular English Plug-and-play Bathroom The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases Friends Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Slug World Wrestling Entertainment
