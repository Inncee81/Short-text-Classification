what do you think the teenage pregnancy rate was in the 's i imagine it's very low but is there anyway to find out i can't find any good sites oh sorry i was not thinking of married teens what i mean was unmarried teens but that answers my question because i guess the stats weren't kept this is one of those things that you will never be able to pinpoint back in the 's and even 's if a teen became pregnant she was usually shuffled off to a relatives house or even a convent they just yanked the girl out of school and away she would go i have to believe most returned home with lies excuses to keep from embarassing their families and to make sure their future spouses did not find out the statistics that the above answerer quoted were concerning married women as unmarried women were shunned and the stats were never kept and lots and lots of pregnant teens become married women pretty quickly so the stats do not take into account those that did not marry the world sure has changed Sexual abstinence EastEnders Teenage pregnancy Abortion debate One Tree Hill (TV series) Sex education Divorce Friends Kurt Cobain Adolescence Days of our Lives Theory of conduct Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy Homosexuality and Christianity Titans (comics) Incarnations of Immortality 2000 Australian Grand Prix Aqua Teen Hunger Force Single parent Abortion Same-sex marriage in Canada Economic inequality Satanic ritual abuse History of As the World Turns (2000-present) Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Blue Heelers Roe v.
