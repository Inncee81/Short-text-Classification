how do i know that i'm pregnant i have gained a little weight like pounds and i always need to go to the bathroom sometimes i dunno if i can hold i'm always nautious tired and i dont sleep well hi sara there are a few steps you would take to know whether you are pregnant for sure however it takes time to be completely sure so if you really need to be sure you will have to be patient first of all you can buy a pregnancy test from a pharmacy or chemist there are several choices available and you can buy a couple to be doubly sure this is the fastest and easiest way to check but it is also only a good estimate next you can go to a doctor or better still a gynaecologist to do a pregnancy test this is better than a self administered test because the doctor can ask you questions or examine you in a way that only an experienced and trained person knows how to this will give you a pretty pretty good indication already finally if you wait a few more months normally by this time you would already know for certain you can do an ultra sound check at a gynaecologist clinic this will show for sure the baby in your womb this test will tell you with absolute certainty that when you are pregnant may i suggest some advice if you are not sure whether you are pregnant please do take great care to avoid things that can harm a baby there may be one in the womb such things include stop smoking not to drink alcohol definitely do not take drugs avoid medicine that put a baby at risk and try to avoid physical activities that can put you at risk of falling down being knocked over etc sometimes such actions can result in an unintended abortion but worse still sometimes they do not result in abortions but result in deformed or retarded growth in the baby Pregnancy Abortion Abortion debate Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Miscarriage Prostate cancer Urinary incontinence Medicine Breastfeeding Childbirth Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Folic acid Prenatal diagnosis Abortion in the United States Stomach cancer In vitro fertilisation Coeliac disease Tocopherol Hypoglycemia Premature birth Prolactinoma Chemical abortion Medical record Haloperidol Intact dilation and extraction Cancer Addiction Roe v.
