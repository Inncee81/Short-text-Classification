pregnant with condom hey everyone i am and i think that i may be pregnant but i am not sure yet let me tell you my story ok so i had my last period on june th i am on a day cycle and wasnt expecting my period until aug st so on july th i had sex with my b f and we used a condom but when we finished we couldnt find the condom after looking around for min we gave up well about an hour later i went to the bathroom and pulled the condom out from inside me it was empty so i assume that the sperm was inside me well on the of july i had some light brown spotting the next full day i had the same thing but then on the th i started what i thought was my period well it was a bit lighter than my normal period and it only lasted days then went back to two more days of spotting do you think i could be pregnant i never spot between periods and i usually have a really heavy one but this wasnt like that and i have been having a constant ache in my lower back i have felt a bit sick on and off have been having some breast tenderness also i am going to take a hpt soon but would like to hear other peoples opinion on if they think i may be prego thanks you could be but until you take the test you can't tell for sure you do have some symptoms but those symptoms also come w your period if your period was light this time the pregnancy could be the reason why no need to panic quite yet until the test but you need to think about it being possible that you could be pregnant and what you are going to have to do i recomend just staying calm until you take the test because if you worry about it a lot your nerves can get to you and you can think that you are feeling sick or your back hurts just because you are worried you could be pregnant so just get the test done asap and hope things work out well good luck Pregnancy Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Oral contraceptive Condom Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Urinary incontinence Breastfeeding Obstetrics EastEnders Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Endometriosis Abortion Birth control Sexual abstinence Safe sex Herpes simplex virus Hey Jude Menstrual cup Columbine High School massacre Oral sex Pornographic movie Autism Big Brother UK series 6 Chronic fatigue syndrome Jam (TV series) Futurama (TV series - season 5) Carpal tunnel syndrome Anxiety Extreme Programming Insomnia Friends Jon Secada Sexual intercourse Kodocha Infantilism Emergency contraception Pelvic inflammatory disease Cytomegalovirus Equine conformation Diabetic retinopathy Clinical depression Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexually-transmitted infection 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Abortion debate Penis Milton H.
