pregnant or not irregular period abortion i had unprotected sex on july but only put my penis in her once and took it out and noticed some wet stuff possibly precum near tip of my penis her periods are irregular she missed periods last year her last period was on june to july she has period for a week and we had unprotected sex incident on july today it is august and she hasnt had her period yet she took an emergency contraceptive pill on july i e hours later questions what are the chances of her getting pregnant when can she take a pregnancy test by its illegal in new zealand to have an abortion unless u have a medical reson or a psychological reason but she wants to have it if she is pregnant does anyone have any experiences in gettting an abortion in a country like new zealand in new zealand any prescription pills are hard to obtain from overseas pharmacies since the customs seize them and ask for prescription papers so how do i obtain abortion pills from oniline pharc thanks for a quick reply guys wow so quick i was surprised my question is this is it possible to have a period on july and then have another one on september but ovulate on august i e in middle of cycle or does that mean she doesnt ovulate at all or does it mean she ovulates days before september thanks well if her period began on june th she probably ovulated sometime around july th with irregular periods that approximation is pretty much useless meaning she could've ovulated a week or more later however if you had unprotected sex on july th the chances of her ovulation already coming and going are very very good despite the fact she's irregular with that in mind the liklihood of her being pregnant is very slim in the unlikely event she is pregnant she wouldn't test positive yet because the fertilization took place five or less days ago i would wait at least a week before testing Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Pregnancy Birth control Abortion debate Ovulation Miscarriage Puberty Hormone replacement therapy (trans) In vitro fertilisation Sexual abstinence Infertility Condom Penis Medical prescription Fertilisation Sexual intercourse Progesterone Polycystic ovary syndrome Sex education Roe v.
