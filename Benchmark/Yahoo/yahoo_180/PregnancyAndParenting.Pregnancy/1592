for all you ladies who are pregnant less then weeks i have a question for you i'm weeks and of course we are all still at risk for miscarriage till we get to second trimester how do u cope with that it just got harder for me cause i thought that if you miscarry it will be obvious like blood in the toilet panties cramping fetal tissue passing but i just asked a question on that and a lot of women miscarry without knowing it meaning their embryo dies but fails to get miscarried out so it still stais embedded in the uterine wall so how do you deal with that knowing that cause i'm kinda going crazy sometimes i cry but mostly i just focus on what i should be doing eating excerising and being a little lazy oh and take my prenatal vitiams this way i've done everything i can and if i miscarry it was nothing i could do but my doctor kept changing my due date and i was stuck the weeks preggers stage for three weeks and that really sucked now i'm weeks finally and the end is in sight good luck Miscarriage Pregnancy Obstetrics Abortion Twin Prenatal diagnosis Menstrual cycle Something Positive Cephalic disorder Intact dilation and extraction Partial-birth abortion Abortion debate Roe v.
