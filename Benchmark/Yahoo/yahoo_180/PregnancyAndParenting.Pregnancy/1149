is it possible i'm currently breastfeeding and didn't get my period for months i got my first period last month it lasted between and four days i had to take a tetanus shot in july maybe that prompted my period to come i'm still breastfeeding and was supposed to get my period days ago i know women do get their period while breastfeeding my question is if it's possible to get my period once and then not get it again i hope i made myself understandable if confused please let me know hi this is very normal i have heard that some women get their mestrual cycles off and on while breastfeeding i would however be cautious about birth control especially if you just had a baby and plan to wait a while because once you begin periods again whether irregular or not it means that there is a possibility of pregnancy so i would think of that i wouldn't worry about irregularities and if you are then talk to your gyn and they will help you find a way to regulate it if it is that important to you depo shots can prevent pregnancy but not affect your milk flow they also can stop your cycle all together until the shot wears off after about three months Breastfeeding Pregnancy Fertility awareness Childbirth Menstrual cycle Emergency contraception Prolactin Birth control Maya calendar Prolactinoma Knots Landing Nipple piercing Oral contraceptive Abortion debate Folic acid Infantilism Urinary incontinence Sudden infant death syndrome Hyperprolactinaemia EastEnders Sharon Tate Cytomegalovirus Infant HIV Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist 1948 Arab-Israeli War Melanie Wilkes Infant formula Jaundice Nestl__ boycott Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) AIDS Social rule Plame affair Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus History of sex Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Endometriosis Progesterone Psoriasis Kodocha Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Niddah Vitamin D Haloperidol StarCraft: Uprising Variable star USS Whale (SS-239) Multiple sclerosis Breast pump Battles of Lexington and Concord Nipple Puberty Milk Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Doxepin Spina bifida 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, vote suppression Medical analysis of circumcision Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Breast cancer Jean Charles de Menezes Al Gore Cephalic disorder Turner syndrome Health issues and the effects of cannabis Premature birth Brassiere In vitro fertilisation Pregnancy fetishism Breast Coeliac disease Menstrual cup Friends Methotrexate The Inside Julian calendar Stroke Sexual abstinence Depo Provera Miscarriage God Emperor of Dune Postnatal Solar eclipse Chernobyl accident Tetanus Hypertension Malaria Giant Panda Days of our Lives Postpartum depression Glacier Marilyn Monroe Poker jargon Infertility Blackadder Srebrenica massacre Obstetrics Bipolar disorder
