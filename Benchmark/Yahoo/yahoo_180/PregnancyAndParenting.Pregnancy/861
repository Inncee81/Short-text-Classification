pregnancy test effectiveness how effective are the cheap no brand pregnancy tests i was hoping to get answers from people who have had experience with them before whether or thanks all pregnancy tests are basically made the same way and are all basically as effective but some can detect lower levels of hcg and will therefore show a positive sooner than others there are some exceptions of course tests can be harder to read than the ones with two lines some tests are also more likely to get evaporation lines but even the worst evaporation line is going to be gray not the correct colour pink or blue depending on the test digital tests theoretically remove user error but i think user error rates are pretty low as long as you don't see only what you want to see some of the more expensive tests even some that say they are very sensitive are in fact not most of the cheap ones are in fact very sensitive the cheapest tests of all are just strips that you dip in urine many doctors offices use these because they are cheaper than the ones in the plastic holders they are just as accurate though many women prefer not to pee in a cup and dip the test in then leave the urine soaked test on a paper towel on the counter basically any test that detects miu ml or less is sensitive and a good test to buy here is a listing of the sensitivity of various tests and any noted problems with the tests http www peeonastick com hpts html Drug test Floppy disk Pregnancy test Human chorionic gonadotropin Pregnancy Prostate cancer Digital photography Explosive material HIV test Redundant array of independent disks Fertility awareness Oscilloscope Color Prolactinoma Microeconomics Gmail Diabetes mellitus Casting Obstetrics Hypoglycemia Cocaine Seismometer Inertial guidance system Condom Password Analog-to-digital converter Bicycle lighting Visual Basic Luminiferous aether Debugging Software testing Embedded system Cascading Style Sheets Menstrual cup CIE 1931 color space Cheating in Counter-Strike PHP Blackjack Gramophone record Strap-on dildo Urinary incontinence Electrophysiology Normal distribution Randomness Theory of conduct Light-emitting diode Naval mine Digital audio broadcasting Pretty Good Privacy Phase-shift keying Domain Name System Solar cell Loudspeaker Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Cytomegalovirus Model (economics) GED Carburetor Hash table MAME Arguments for and against drug prohibition Web crawler Hydrogen economy Radiation hardening DVD RFID Mouse (computing) Credit card Error correction and detection Abortion debate Laserdisc Coffee Copy protection Atari 8-bit family Pump It Up Plastic Cancer Volleyball Digital circuit Inflation Gonorrhoea Literacy Western blot Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Expert system Hydrogen peroxide PID controller Bell's theorem Extreme Programming Human sexual behavior
