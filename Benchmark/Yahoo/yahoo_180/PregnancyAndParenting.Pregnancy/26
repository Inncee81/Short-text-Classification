getting really old ok this girl at work keeps pushing me i have worked with her twice and both times she pushed me like if she thinks i'm in her way she just elbows me away it's getting on my nerves it's happened three times i'm almost weeks pregnant and my balance isn't very good anymore so when she does this it catches me off guard and i don't want to fall my schedule changes in a week so i probably won't be working with her anymore is it even worth it to bring it up to my boss when she did it tonight i said there is water all over the floor and i'm not trying to fall on my face and all she said is i hope not i think you should confront your boss don't worry about being called a narc or snitch she has no business pushing you around especially with the fact that you are weeks pregnant you should try talking to her and telling her you don't appreciate being pushed around if she accepts this and you two compromise then there will be no reason for you to confront your boss whichever one you want to do they're both good ideas EastEnders Professional wrestling holds Jennifer Lopez Friends Shaggy dog story Eddie Guerrero 2004 Republican National Convention Syphon Filter Humphrey Bogart Phoebe Halliwell Cliff Richard God Emperor of Dune Nico Robin Professional wrestling aerial techniques Pok__mon Live!
