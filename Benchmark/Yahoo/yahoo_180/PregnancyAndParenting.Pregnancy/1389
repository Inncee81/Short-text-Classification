pregnant nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo i had unprotected sex on july but only put my penis in her once and took it out and noticed some wet stuff possibly precum near tip of my penis her periods are irregular she missed periods last year her last period was on june to july she has period for a week and we had unprotected sex incident on july today it is august and she hasnt had her period yet she took an emergency contraceptive pill on july i e hours later questions what are the chances of her getting pregnant when can she take a pregnancy test by it is unlikely that she is pregnant if it was weeks since her last period when you had unprotected sex but if her cycle is irregular it could be a small possibility i think the emergency contraceptive is most effective if taken within hours of the unprotected sex but a pharmacist or doctor is the best person to discuss this with you can take a home pregnancy test anytime but they are usually most effective from when her period is due eg weeks after her last one so she should be able to take one now best to do it first thing in the morning for accurate result good luck but maybe you should think about contraception even if it interferes with flow of the moment cause all this stress is bad for you and her Emergency contraception Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Birth control Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Oral sex Sex education Abortion debate Big Brother UK series 6 Condom Androgen insensitivity syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Sexual intercourse Gonorrhoea Obstetrics Sexual abstinence Neighbours Intrauterine device Safe sex Abortion Urinary incontinence Anal sex Twin Miscarriage Pelvic inflammatory disease Hypertension Pornographic movie Teenage pregnancy Psoriasis Depo Provera Endometriosis Hypospadias Prostate cancer Maprotiline AIDS Acne Herpes simplex virus Strap-on dildo Sexual revolution Chernobyl accident Infertility Prenatal diagnosis Human penis size Turner syndrome Childbirth History of sex Myocardial infarction Harm reduction In vitro fertilisation Stomach cancer 2004 U.S. presidential election recounts and legal challenges Electrophysiology Abortion in Canada Caffeine Practices of Jehovah's Witnesses Congenital adrenal hyperplasia Polycystic ovary syndrome Pregnancy test Laura Schlessinger USS Waters (DD-115) Folic acid Target Corporation Orgasm Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Tocopherol Personal lubricant Human sexual behavior Roswell UFO incident Hurricane Rita Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Genital wart Human sexuality Social rule Normal distribution Gregory Goodwin Pincus Old wives' tale Puberty Common misconceptions about HIV and AIDS Menstrual cup Stroke Human adaptation to space Prayer Soap opera G-Man (Half-Life) Douche Hepatitis C Thalidomide Schapelle Corby Extreme Programming Roman Catholic Church Michelson-Morley experiment John Holmes (actor) Breastfeeding Aortic dissection Guinea pig Glossary of firefighting terms Infantilism
