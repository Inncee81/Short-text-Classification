i have to have an abortion how do i deal with this my unborn baby has been diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease and i have been told by seperate doctors that this baby will no live and the best bet would be for me to abort it i have dealt with this before feb with another baby my son had the same disease and died in my arms after hr minutes that was the worst and best moments of my life but do not feel that i could handle that again i am already feeling anxiety about this procedure which is scheduled for thurs th what should i do to cope with my grief and emotional instability i feel that this is the only way for me so please do not judge me please i am a very active pro life person but i do not want to give birth to my baby and watch it suffer as my other child did i already have two beautiful little boys a year old and a month old you know to g i your response greatly disturbs me what is it any of your buisness as to how close i have my children the doctors told me before i got pregnant that this is a very random disease and it would not happen again well you know their not perfect my husband and i had agreed to have another child therefore we got pregnant i am asking for opinions on how to deal with my situation not be dogged on about how my children are too close i too had a baby die at birth and i don't think that i could emotionally go through that again i am so sorry that this is happening to you i like you am a pro life supporter but there is a drastic difference from aborting because of medical reasons and doing it because you did not want to have a baby keep your head high you have nothing to be ashamed of as far as dealing with the emotions just try to remember you did it so your child would not suffer i applaud your courage good luck Abortion debate Miscarriage EastEnders Abortion in the United States Roe v.
