ok i have a question about being pregnant me and my boyfriend had sex on unprotected we also had sex on unprotected as of i am days late i have taken tests in the afternoon and all said negative the one i took on was with fmu and it was such a faint line i wondered if it wasn't even an evap line on monday i had a light brown discharge and that was it which was when my period was actually due to start i think could i have gotten pregnant from the lovemaking and the brown discharge was implantation bleeding but its too early for a test to show positive or could i have gotten pregnant from the lovemaking and the discharge was possibly my period getting ready to start but didn't cause technically the egg had been fertilized my cycles are all over the place so it's hard to tell when i actually ovulate and we aren't preventing pregnancy because neither one of us is worried about if it happens or not we would be happy as could be if i am i'm just confused please any info would be so much appriciated no potential for it being different fathers same boyfriend just different dates not likely an std either since we are only having sex with each other for the last year and a half take another test with your first morning urine Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Oral contraceptive Gonorrhoea Emergency contraception Pelvic inflammatory disease In vitro fertilisation Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Condom Birth control Ovulation Sexual intercourse Obstetrics Infertility Pregnancy test Neighbours Miscarriage Estrus cycle Sexual abstinence Oral sex Knots Landing EastEnders Human chorionic gonadotropin Drug test Twin Anal sex George W.
