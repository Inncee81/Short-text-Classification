i just found out that i am wks pregnant this is my st i am contemplating termination what r the risks i am concerned it will affect my ability to have kids in the future what are the procedures for an abortion will i bleed alot and is it painful there are quite a few risks involed with terminating a pregnancy but it is ultimately up to you risk of infection probably being the top risk especially if you have intercourse less than a week after the procedure since the cervix may not be completely closed an abortion does not effect your chances of becoming pregnant in the future as much as most people think most people that say that are anti abortionists i terminated a pregnancy last october and have not tried to conceive since nor was i at the time on my period and birth control at time of conception but have no perminate problems from the procedure i only bled moderate heavy for a couple days then light bleeding for about weeks next period came right on time i was only weeks gestiation at the time of the abortion a week earlier than the doctor thought but they still did the procedure they ususally start at weeks my experience was quite painful since i was so early in my pregnancy they took their time to make sure it was done correctly but i only took an advil and antibiotic before the procedure they offered valium but i was by myself and didn't want to drive while on valium make sure you eat breakfast because that double dose of antibiotic will make you sick on an empty stomach if you have any other questions or just need someone to talk to that has been through this experience feel free to email or im me i will be glad to talk good luck and remember it is your decision no one else's Miscarriage Abortion Pregnancy Abortion debate Oral contraceptive Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Fertility awareness Gonorrhoea Birth control Menstrual cycle Obstetrics Breastfeeding Stomach cancer Abortion in the United States Cancer Psoriasis Folic acid Diazepam Endometriosis Chemical abortion Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Prostate cancer Teenage pregnancy Tocopherol Pelvic inflammatory disease Acne Spina bifida Prenatal diagnosis Ectopic pregnancy In vitro fertilisation Emergency contraception Abortion in Canada Pneumonia Adjustable gastric band Urinary incontinence Sexual intercourse Diabetic retinopathy Isotretinoin Stroke Condom Anencephaly Stenberg v.
