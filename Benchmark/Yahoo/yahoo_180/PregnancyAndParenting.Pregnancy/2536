should i skip an appointment i had my monthly ob appointment on monday august th everything was great i am weeks today i have my next appointment on september th the thing is my husband just accepted a new job today and our benefits will not start until november st i thought about paying for the september appointment out of pocket but no one can give me an answer on how much it is going to cost i got a range of i can't afford this i thought about just skipping my september appointment until my new insurance is in effect any thoughts my husband is trying to contact hr at his current job to see if he can use pto to extend his insurance benefit time that's good that your husband is checking into that and did you know you can also extend your coverage as a private holder as well you don't necessarily have to have the company as a sponsor you can buy it privately it's usually more expensive but just buy it on a monthly basis then drop it when your new insurance kicks in also make sure that the new insurance does not deem pregnancy as a pre existing condition most policies don't but a lot won't pro rate or offer retro active coverage at the time the insurance kicks in so there could be a lot of head ache involved in making sure everything is covered even if you skip an appt but i wouldn't think there'd be a problem with skipping an appt just make sure you notify your doctor good luck and congrats Health insurance Life insurance Publicly funded medicine Microeconomics Mortgage Auto insurance Wal-Mart Unemployment benefit Unemployment Mutual fund Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Contract U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Canadian and American health care systems compared Privatization Medicare (Canada) Annuity Tax Health care in the United States FairTax Intellectual property Major League Baseball television contracts US health reform under FDR Social Security (United States) Capitalism Legal aspects of transsexualism Lloyd's of London Channel 4 Medical malpractice EastEnders Bond Warren Buffett Productive and unproductive labour Barbara Boxer Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Bank Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Natural monopoly National Kidney Foundation Singapore The Apprentice 2 National Insurance NFL on television United Kingdom corporation tax Trade union Social rule Risk management Outsourcing Condom Great Depression Economics Professor Citigroup George W.
