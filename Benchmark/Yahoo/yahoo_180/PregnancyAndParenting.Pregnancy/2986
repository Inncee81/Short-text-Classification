i've been diagnosed with pcos had glucophage and its been over a yr that my cycle is back to normal but what am i doing wrong that i am still not pregnant i've been ask to go for repeated scan to check the status of my folicles but till todate nothings happening what do i do is ivf the next solution i am tired of this treatment nothing seems to be happening well been trying for less then yrs with no sucess i try not think abt it but my mum in law keeps asking every now n then worrying whats going on n that triggers me to start thinking its not that i dont want it its not happening i am about to give you an answer you may not like to hear i too was diagnosed with pcos and had problems getting pregnant i went through months of clomid fertility treatment and nothing about months after that i got pregnant and had a very early miscarriage they called it a chemical pregnancy it's where the egg is fertilized but not implanted i was told that it was due to my pcos and in turn my body did not create enough progesterone to sustain a healthy pregnancy after many specialists and looking into ivf i decided to do a little research on my own all of this put a strain on my st marriage and i divorced a few years later i drove myself crazy for years wondering why my body would not accomodate a baby and trying to get pregnant for years finally in order for my heart to heal i gave up on the idea i researched pcos and one of the big things that i learned was that i should excersize and eat right that basically with pcos i was making too much insulin i weighed lbs at my heaviest and had hair growing everywhere i started working out just walking at first and after months i was down to lbs my cycles became regular for the first time in my life and the hair that was growing on my face went away i saw an ob and they claimed that i indeed had reversed the pcos i then met next husband since i was now i decided it was too late for children i chose to go on the depo shot to help with painful cramping and heavy bleeding i experienced with my cycles this was supposed to stop the bleeding and is very effective birth control i took the shot in november and got pregnant in january i'm now weeks pregnant so the point of my story once i let the issue go for me it was very emotional and started to take care of myself my body followed naturally i think i let myself get really sick over the inability to concieve and have a baby once i healed from all of it and gave up years later boom pregnant i feel i allowed the medical community dictate my fertility when they told me i was sick and needed all kinds of interventions to get pregnant and even then they may not work i believed them i was so concerned with what they said that i did not even think to follow basic healthy patterns to get well please do some research start exercising it never hurt anyone don't believe everything they tell you and the biggest thing is to relax let nature take it's course if all of the above does not work then consider ivf i know that for me i am grateful that everything happened exactly when it did looking back there was a very good reason for it all my very best wishes Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding EastEnders Obstetrics Abortion debate Endometriosis Miscarriage Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fertility awareness Prostate cancer Childbirth Infertility Abortion Clinical depression Stomach cancer Coeliac disease Urinary incontinence Marilyn Monroe Humphrey Bogart Terri Schiavo Stem cell Friends Ectopic pregnancy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Chronic fatigue syndrome Human cloning Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Theory of conduct Neighbours Insulin Kodocha Domestic violence Church of Christ, Scientist Hypoglycemia First aid Guinea pig Theodicy Milton H.
