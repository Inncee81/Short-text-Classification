could i have miscarried as of today i was days late for my period i had taken hpts after a week of being and both were negative however for the past days i had had cramping vaginal pains off and on and my breasts were slightly tender often like what happens a day or two before my period arrives today around noon within an hour the cramps got brutal and i immediately began passing some brownish red discharge a few hours later when i had to pee i noticed a few streaks of blood in the water stemming out from a small white clot no more than a centimeter in diameter stupidly i didn't look closer and just flushed it as of tonight of the same day the bleeding has mostly stopped save a small amount of brownish discharge when i wipe the tenderness in my breasts has decreased significantly but i still have some cramping in my abdomen and lower back i'm wondering if i could have miscarried i'm confused because from what i read miscarriages tend to be accompanied by a lot of blood it could have been a miscarriage or may be also as you had got your periods late Miscarriage Menstrual cycle Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Obstetrics Premature birth Dialysis Fertility awareness Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Androgen insensitivity syndrome Stomach cancer Endometriosis Breastfeeding Abortion Childbirth Nuclear fallout Puberty Oral contraceptive Menstrual cup Stroke First aid Equine conformation Urinary incontinence Action potential Gonorrhoea Endometrial cancer Needle aspiration biopsy USS Tunny (SS-282) Intracranial pressure Breech birth Ectopic pregnancy Paracetamol Explosive material Traumatic brain injury Operation Market Garden Cramp Decompression sickness Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Internal ballistics Swimming Myocardial infarction USS Waters (DD-115) Tocopherol The Inside Gout Ovarian cancer Jet engine USS Taylor (DD-468) Capercaillie Lightning Blood pressure Prostate cancer Caesarean section USS Albemarle (AV-5) Pelvic inflammatory disease Leukemia Chlamydia Battles of Lexington and Concord Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Coronary heart disease Group A streptococcal infection Stopping power Drowning Gynaecology Human sexual response cycle Professional wrestling slang Maprotiline Tightlacing Spirit rover timeline for 2004 February Astronomy on Mars Deluge (mythology) Turbofan Blood Wood Exosquad characters Orgasm Pregnancy Spider Haloperidol Blood on the Tracks USS S-35 (SS-140) Testicular cancer Mosquito Acute lymphoblastic leukemia Diazepam Appendicitis Asteroid Spacecraft propulsion Daylight saving time COX-2 inhibitor Hypoglycemia Carbon dioxide USS Alden (DD-211) Urine Chinese calendar Mississippi River Extraterrestrial skies Atherosclerosis
