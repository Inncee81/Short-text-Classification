possibly pregnant ok so i had sex about weeks ago without a condom on accident but i took the morning after pill days later which is ok and then i started regular birth control well i've been having really bad cramps but my period isnt supposed to start for another week today they just hurt really bad and i was wondering if anybody knew what the heck it was or if i could be pregnant thanks for the help it's possible for you to be pregnant considering the morning after pill is only effective if you really want to be safe you can take a pregnancy test neither plan b nor birth control would kill an embryo already implanted so if that occurred before you took them which is possible hence the failure rate then you would still be pregnant best of luck Pregnancy Birth control Emergency contraception Oral contraceptive Menstrual cycle Fertility awareness Twin Condom Obstetrics Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Endometriosis Abortion debate In vitro fertilisation Miscarriage Friends Safe sex Ectopic pregnancy EastEnders Psoriasis Urinary incontinence Sex education Folic acid Gonorrhoea Morning sickness Caffeine Childbirth Chemical abortion Teenage pregnancy Intrauterine device Prenatal diagnosis Tocopherol Neighbours Acne Thalidomide Turner syndrome Pelvic inflammatory disease Harm reduction Guinea pig AIDS Cephalic disorder Depo Provera Multiple birth Herpes simplex virus Partial-birth abortion 2000 Australian Grand Prix Pregnancy test Sexual revolution Sexual intercourse Premature birth Breastfeeding Hypertension Embryo transfer Oral sex Sexual abstinence Religion and abortion Boston Public Spina bifida Infertility Chernobyl accident Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pregnancy fetishism One Life to Live Sexual reproduction Male pregnancy Cytomegalovirus Lucille Ball The Gap Cycle Maprotiline Diabetes mellitus Days of our Lives Knots Landing Fertilisation Syphilis Hearing impairment Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Creatine Abortion in the United States Roswell UFO incident Marriage Vernon Schillinger Kate Vaiden Human penis size HIV Ravi Shastri The Venture Bros.
