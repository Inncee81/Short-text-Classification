to all those who are pregnant i'm ttc and i'm just wondering how long it took all of you to get pregnant and if you used drugs ov stick or just got lucky i love to hear about how others got pregnant congrats on your bundle of joy wow thats great i love hearing about others it makes me less stressed and hopeful i got my mirena iud removed in may my husband and i just decided to let things happen and relax about it it drove me crazy the first month but after that i found peace with it it seems like everyone who really tries hard has a difficult time but those who take it easy or arent even trying get pregnant go figure so we didnt use any method at all i didnt even try to track my ovulation and see what days we should have sex on we just went about life as usual i just found out that i am pregnant a few days ago i'm about weeks along this is our second child our first daughter was conceived on the last day of my period plus we were using a condom and the pill talk about meant to be if you were on hormonal birth control before it can take longer to conceive it just depends on the individual about of couples having unprotected sex conceive within a year i would say to just relax about it all and not to see a doctor unless it goes over a year the anxiety of ttc can have a profound impact on your body so i really think its beneficial to have some inner peace about it i just told myself that it didnt matter how long it took because that just gave us even more time to prepare and enjoy our daughter good luck to you and rest assured that whenever your baby comes it will be the perfect time Oral contraceptive Fertility awareness Birth control Menstrual cycle Pregnancy Emergency contraception Neighbours Urinary incontinence Infertility EastEnders Abortion debate Social rule Psoriasis Intrauterine device Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Abortion Miscarriage Days of our Lives Sharon Tate Married... with Children In vitro fertilisation Breastfeeding Chronic fatigue syndrome Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Sant Thakar Singh Anal sex Scenes from a Memory Enneagram AIDS Acne Marriage Shaggy dog story Kodocha Condom Infantilism Theory of conduct Sexual abstinence Humphrey Bogart Bipolar disorder Knots Landing Folic acid Happiness Hearing impairment One Tree Hill (TV series) Sleep Puberty Fiddler on the Roof Out-of-body experience Anxiety Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boom Town (Doctor Who) Le Malade imaginaire Property (ownership right) Oral sex Jean Grey Sleeping Murder Alanis Morissette Jam (TV series) Obstetrics Jon Secada Friends Meditation Sola fide Childbirth Simone Weil Herpes simplex virus Kurt Cobain Too Short a Season (TNG episode) History of sex Guinea pig Clinical depression Toronto Subway and RT Romulus and Remus Heracles Anorexia nervosa Phoebe Halliwell Eastern Orthodox Church Sant Mat Endometriosis John Sheridan (Babylon 5) 2004 Republican National Convention Characters of Lost Cytomegalovirus The Ashlee Simpson Show Transactional analysis The Death Gate Cycle Homosexuality and transgender Sexual revolution Orgasm Coffee Sex education Elvis and Me Cliff Richard Caffeine Rod Stewart Great Teacher Onizuka
