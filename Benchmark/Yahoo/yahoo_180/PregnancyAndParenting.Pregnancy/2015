what's going on pregnant i'm very concerned i just had my period and it came back again yesterday i'm very tired my lower back feels like it's going to crack what is this it's extremely heavy and i'm cramping my chest also feels tight from time to time thanks probably not pregnant but i'm not a doctor so i can't say with certainty heavy bleeding doesn't constitute pregnancy but it can mean you have an ovarian cyst it's definitely worth going to the doctor and getting a pap you should always take your health seriously i would make an appointment for as soon as possible if it's nothing and just one weird period at least you know and you can feel better knowledge is power how cliche of me lol Endometriosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Pregnancy Menstrual cycle Breastfeeding Miscarriage Endometrial cancer Prostate cancer Ovarian cyst Polycystic ovary syndrome Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ectopic pregnancy Roe v.
