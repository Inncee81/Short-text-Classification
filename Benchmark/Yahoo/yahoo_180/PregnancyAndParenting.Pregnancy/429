question about epidural if you get an epidural after the delivery is all over with do they have to give you a cathider sp or will you be able to tell that you have to use the bathroom and be able to actually go i was just curious as to what to expect i had an epidural with all of my babies and with the st they put in a catheder when they gave me the epidural then wih the nd didn't put one on me i wet the bed and the rd i was induced and wasn't allowed to get up once they gave me the pitocin and after i was given the epidural they did put a catheder in me only because i said i had to go to the restroom and i think if i remember right it was right before i delivered anyways when you have an epi they will try and empty your bladder before you push and afterwards right after delivery and before the epidural completely wears off they will use a catheder but all times were different when they used one and when they didn't and i was at the same hospital all times so i guess it just depends on the nurses doctors and stuff maybe but when it wears off usually pretty quick kinda for me anyways you know when you have to go heck don't worry about it that's what the nurses are there for to clean up anyways relax while you're there because once you get back home with the baby trust me you will want a epi and cath just to get an hours straight of sleep lol op but it's all worth it my girls are and now congrats about your pregnancy and good luck with the delivery Childbirth Urinary incontinence Caesarean section Obstetrics Pregnancy EastEnders Breastfeeding Epidural Milton H.
