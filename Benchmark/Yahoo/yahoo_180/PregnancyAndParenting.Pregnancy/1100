after a miscarriage when is your period due i had a miscarraige july nd i was weeks i haven't had my period i stopped bleeding on the th when should i expect to have my period i want to start trying again but the doctor said to wait for at least one cycle i may be no help to you because i had a miscarriage and totally ignored the doctors instructions to wait to try again needless to say thank god i didnt wait because i got pregnant again right away and never even had a period the only reason why the doctor says to wait a cycle is so that if you do get pregnant they can have a better idea of how far along you are dont worry though because they will do an ultrasound to see that for sure in the begining and so you actually get to see your baby early anyways your body doesnt need time to heal or anything because it was never hurt or sick this is actually the best time to try since your body is still in ''baby mode so you are more fertile for the first three months as far as when you should start your period i think it varries but dont be scared to try again now i didnt wait and it was the best decision i ever made Pregnancy Miscarriage Obstetrics Atomic Kitten Fertility awareness Menstrual cycle Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Stomach cancer Abortion Breastfeeding Coeliac disease Prostate cancer Spina bifida Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Gothic metal Abortion debate Intact dilation and extraction CPU design Premature birth Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Childbirth Polycystic ovary syndrome Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Androgen insensitivity syndrome Alois Hitler Religion and abortion RISC Hebrew calendar Central processing unit Niddah Gonorrhoea Breech birth Abortion in the United States Alternative medicine Maya calendar Vaginal bleeding The Inside Le Malade imaginaire Morning sickness Urinary incontinence Theory of conduct Horus Triage Computer multitasking Guinea pig In vitro fertilisation Prenatal care Sami Brady Partial-birth abortion Church of Christ, Scientist Time Jon Secada Prenatal diagnosis Melanie Wilkes Female genital cutting Computus Piccolo Junior Saga CPU cache Stillbirth Ovarian cyst Health insurance One Tree Hill (TV series) Heartworm Survivor (novel) Shaggy dog story Kodocha Father's Day (Doctor Who) Gynaecology The Curse of Fenric Jennifer Lopez Ben Johnson (athlete) Social rule Ayurveda Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial Paige Matthews Bleeding Sharon Tate Milton H.
