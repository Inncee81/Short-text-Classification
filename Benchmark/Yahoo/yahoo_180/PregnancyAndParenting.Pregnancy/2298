what does a baby girl's parts look like on a sonogram i got a sonogram the tech said it was a boy but comparing my sonogram pics to others online it looks more like a girl it has white lines on each side and then smaller white lines next to the bigger white lines confusing just wondered if anyone had a good explanation as to what a girl sonogram looks like a girl should be white lines my dr told me though that they are less correct determining the gender of girls so i don't know about the lines i don't know that is confusing just whatever you do don't cut the tags off of clothes so you can take them to exchange if they are wrong my us with this baby was confusing too and they told me it was a girl i had strong feelings it was a boy i screwed up and took the tags off all my girl clothes and washed them so i hope the tech was right and this is a girl otherwise someone that is having a girl is going to be lucky to receive all my baby clothes Cliff Richard Transsexuality AFI 100 Years series Jennifer Lopez Max Martin Hip hop collaborations Upholstery Milton H.
