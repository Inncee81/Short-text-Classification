how does your husband behave during pregnancy i don t ask my fianc much tonight i was tired and i asked him to make a tea but i forgot to ask for honey so he brought this tea and refused to bring this stupid honey then there was a conversation about me trying to take an advantage of him and inventing the entire story of tea then honey just to check something about him then i said that he should not worry about me taking advantage of him since after i give birth i will leave him if he is so scared then he said make an abortion hmm not good maybe someone should send him to pregnancy classes or hand him a book has he never heard of hormones he likely is scared too so you might want to remember to be supportive of him too although really lots of guys seem to be useless during pregnancy especially if it wasn't planned Social rule EastEnders Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion Avenue Q Birth control Knots Landing Pregnancy Oral contraceptive Emergency contraception Singlish Breastfeeding Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Futurama (TV series - season 5) Cliff Richard Jacob Marilyn Monroe The Death Gate Cycle Humphrey Bogart Time Out of Mind Kodocha Russian joke Rent (musical) Jon Secada The Catcher in the Rye Sin City Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Inside Radio Yerevan Roe v.
