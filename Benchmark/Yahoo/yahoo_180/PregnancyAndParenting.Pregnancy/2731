ok got really good opinions but really want more please read and answer my question first time mom ok well the dr keeps bouncing back and forth as to how far along i am he says weeks one week the next any who here is my question i had an internal exam today to see if i was dialated or anything he said that your cervice starts out at inchecs thick and mine is now about and inches thick and i have lost about inch does this mean that my cervics is efacing he also said my cervics is closed i asume that is no dialation but that he can put a finger in there and feel the babys head he is going on vacation for a week but said when he gets back that he will rough me up to get things moving does that mean that he will strip membranes or something i would have asked all this to him but i was not really dumbfounded until i got home and started thinking about what he had said any opinions are aprecated what do you make of this thanks to the two who answered already its aprecated just wanted a few more opinions i guess you would have to know the dr to understand his sence of humor the rough you up comment is just him he is really a good dr i really like him and would not change i just had a dumb moment and didnt understand what he ment exactly thanks congrats i too am a new mommy you seem to be efacing a bit and as to your cervics you start to eface before you dialate so you can be completly closed and then your cervics will thin out and you will start to dialate i am thinking what he means about roughing you up would be either inducing you which means to start labor and contractions with pitossin or another drug to get things moving along because wks is considered a full term pregnancy so if you have made it there then he may let you go to wks to see if your body will go into labor naturally if not then you most like will be induced unless there are complications another method to get things moving along would be to break your water which usually starts contractions and labor but if he felt the baby's head which you can do without being dialted then that means the baby is in position to deliver and the baby comes when he or she is ready so hang in there and good luck hope this helps Childbirth Abortion Cervix Abortion debate Breastfeeding Fertility awareness Breech birth Table tennis Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Birth control Miscarriage Friends Textile manufacturing Action potential Shaggy dog story Sharon Tate Fast bowling Intact dilation and extraction Gonorrhoea Premature birth Contract Sydney Riot of 1879 Prostate cancer Laws of cricket The nature of God in Western theology Jon Secada Milton H.
