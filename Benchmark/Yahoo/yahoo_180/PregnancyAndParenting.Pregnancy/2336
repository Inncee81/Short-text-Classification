has anyone's doctor been wrong about their pregnancy i had the most tramatic experience yesterday i'm weeks pregnant i had felt some mild pain my lower left side and the doctor did an ultrasound just to check where the baby was well she couldn't find the baby not even a sac she got me an appointment at radiology hours later the longest hours of my life for a more detailed scan to see if they could locate the pregnany in my tubes my hcg's were over so we knew there was a baby with a beating heart somewhere she had also told me she felt a mass on my left side perhaps in my tube she talked to me about surgery for an ectopic and what would happen and all that well last night after a minute scan where the tech didn't say a word at first just looked really serious she finally looked at me and saw i was upset and then turned the screen around and showed me my baby and it's beating heart in my uterus i couldn't believe it i shareb this to remind people that doctors are not always correct and to keep hope sorry i mispelled a couple of words i was typing fast luckily this isn't my real doctor she shouldn't be doing ultasounds if she doesn't know how thank you all for sharing your stories oh my that had to have traumatic to go through that thank goodness everything is alright i had a similar experience with my last pregnancy i was only weeks along and was having excruciating back pain so i went to the er and the doctor told me that my hcg level was extremely low and that i should repeat the test two days later i went home and saw on a chart of hcg levels that my levels were above range for my being only weeks so i went two days later and waited for the results and they had quadrupled i found out at weeks that not only was my baby in there but that i had two babies so this er doctor had no idea what she was looking at and made me go through all this worry that perhaps i had lost my baby sometimes i have the desire to take the babies back to that er and give her a piece of my mind the babies were born last september at weeks they are healthy babies good luck in your pregnancy Miscarriage Obstetrics Pregnancy Prostate cancer Prenatal diagnosis Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Menstrual cycle Spina bifida Childbirth Theory of conduct In vitro fertilisation Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Breech birth Urinary incontinence Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Ectopic pregnancy Breastfeeding Days of our Lives Abortion Endometriosis Shaggy dog story Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Pregnancy test One Tree Hill (TV series) Stroke Pitaten Fertility awareness Kodocha Social rule Scientology beliefs and practices Hypoglycemia Folic acid Gonorrhoea Traumatic brain injury Stomach cancer Ben Johnson (athlete) Hey Jude Infantilism Premature birth Piccolo Junior Saga Jam (TV series) The Parting of the Ways Killian documents Gastroparesis Cryptorchidism Conspiracy (TNG episode) Cephalic disorder Cliff Richard Neighbours Milton H.
