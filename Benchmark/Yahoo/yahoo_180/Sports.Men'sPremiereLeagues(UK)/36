what did you think about arsenal vs fulham personally arsenal is lacking experiance all wenger does is bring youths and we have to wait years until they gain experince to win but they have a chance at the title go gooners thank god van persie wasnt hurt my heart sunk when he got swiped by the goalkeeper what about you what did you think about todays game i think this isn't the real arsenal we will see because the goal came too early and we got a miraculous win at the end but honestly all big teams have their problems at the beggining just look at chelsea right now wait big team haha can't wait to see them next week and if we keep playing that inspiring football we are up for the title Chelsea F.C.
