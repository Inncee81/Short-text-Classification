what do you think of this song i find the map and draw a straight line over rivers farms and state lines the distance from 'a' to where you'd be it's only finger lengths that i see i touch the place where i'd find your face my finger in creases of distant dark places i hang my coat up in the first bar there is no peace that i've found so far the laughter penetrates my silence as drunken men find flaws in science their words mostly noises ghosts with just voices your words in my memory are like music to me i'm miles from where you are i lay down on the cold ground i i pray that something picks me up and sets me down in your warm arms after i have travelled so far we'd set the fire to the third bar we'd share each other like an island until exhausted close our eyelids and dreaming pick up from the last place we left off your soft skin is weeping a joy you can't keep in i'm miles from where you are i lay down on the cold ground and i i pray that something picks me up and sets me down in your warm arms i'm miles from where you are i lay down on the cold ground and i i pray that something picks me up and sets me down in your warm arms i love this song Salad Fingers Fast bowling Jiddu Krishnamurti Volleyball Aerial (dance move) The Amber Spyglass Archery Comanche Professional wrestling holds Night (book) Sin City Captain Thunderbolt Horizontal bar Paul Is Dead Salute Physical characteristics of the Buddha Harp Opportunity rover RuneScape quests Gesture Laws of cricket Customs and etiquette of Japan Landing at Anzac Cove Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an USS Tunny (SS-282) Robert Falcon Scott Blood on the Tracks Muslim ibn Aqeel Miss Saigon Charles Peace Odyssey The Second Renaissance StarCraft: Uprising Canoe Vulcan (Star Trek) Hugo Wolf Prank flash The Time Machine Shaggy dog story Violin SETI Song Escape from New York Ammunition Guitar Joy Division (band) Isaac Asimov Bay Area Rapid Transit Wassily Kandinsky Drill bit English longbow Funeral Lake District Cricket Slayers USS Whale (SS-239) Fiddler on the Roof Knife Michel Henry Battles of Lexington and Concord The Jazz Singer Reaction to the assassination of John F.
