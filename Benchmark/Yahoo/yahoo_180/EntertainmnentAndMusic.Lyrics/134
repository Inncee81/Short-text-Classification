omg help find song title killing me to find out i can barely remember a few parts of the lyrics oooooooo oooooooo high beat music like dance or something ooooooooooo something here the song keeps repeating i talk to you but not all at once just throughout the song i talk to you i talk to you is sung getting higher in notes when you sing it close to the ending is like where would i go what will i do if you want to get me through i think by the way this song is kinda old melanie c aka sporty spice i turn to you when the world is darker than i can understand when nothing turns out the way i planned when the sky turns grey and there's no end in sight when i can't sleep through the lonely night i turn to you like a flower leaning toward the sun i turn to you 'cos you're the only one who can turn me around when i'm upside down i turn to you when my insides are wracked with anxiety you have the touch that will quiet me you lift my spirit you melt the ice when i need inspiration when i need advice i turn to you like a flower leaning toward the sun i turn to you 'cos you're the only one who can turn me around when i'm upside down i turn to you where would i be what would i do if you'd never helped me through i hope someday if you've lost your way you could turn to me like i turn to you i turn to you like a flower leaning toward the sun i turn to you 'cos you're the only one who can turn me around when i'm upside down i turn to you i turn to you when fear tells me to turn around i turn to you 'cos you're the only one who can turn me around when i'm upside down i turn to you i turn to you i turn to you Spice Girls Jon Secada Melanie Chisholm Peter Gabriel The Emancipation of Mimi Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Paul Is Dead Cliff Richard Roxette Aerial (dance move) Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show The Time Machine Palpatine Heavy metal music Lorentz group A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square Harry Nilsson Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Battle of the Alamo Hansel und Gretel Time Out of Mind Swingout Diana Ross Skinny Puppy Advance Wars: Dual Strike Genesis (band) We Belong Together Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Bee Gees EastEnders Tumbleweed Connection Rich Mullins Sting (musician) Vernon Schillinger Kurt Cobain Tears for Fears Professional wrestling holds Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Father's Day (Doctor Who) Knots Landing Gregg Alexander Empire Burlesque Opportunity rover The Velvet Underground Liam Gallagher Nu metal One-hit wonder The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases The Amber Spyglass Killing Joke Blur Escape from New York Gary Glitter Naruto jutsu Bryan Adams Jean Grey Trigonometric function Zhao Yun Music of Jamaica Hip hop rivalries Janet Jackson A Day in the Life Chucky Pancamo Faye Wong Paul McCartney Nirvana (band) Book of Isaiah Frankie Laine Blues A-ha Shrek 2 Sin City U2 (band) American Pie (song) Garth Brooks Waylon Jennings Roman surface The Isley Brothers The Misfits 3D projection Aquemini Kate Bush Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Joy Division (band) Another Side of Bob Dylan Deftones Beatles for Sale Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.
