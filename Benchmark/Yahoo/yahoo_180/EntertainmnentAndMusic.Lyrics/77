does anyone know the lyrics to moving along by metro station i cant find them at all you know we're moving along x i wish i could have told you all the things i once had to say in the sheets i kept real quiet these motions are useless that's wat i'd say i remember when you rode down on the metro just to tell me love is real love is real but that's not how i feel you get close i keep my distance i never thought i would miss this i think somethings going wrong you can feel it in this song x you know we're moving along x i never felt more like dying when you left i felt so empty my body aches i'm so damn cold i still can't feel you inside of me now i feel like nothings working this pain is growing now i'm asking was it real was it real i can't stop what i feel you get close i keep my distance i never thought i would miss this i think somethings going wrong you can feel it in this wong x you know we're moving along x The Amber Spyglass Jon Secada Piccolo Junior Saga The Death Gate Cycle Jean Grey Public transport Hip hop rivalries Virginia Lewis (The 10th Kingdom) The Inside Hey Jude Blood on the Tracks Blood (computer game) Leo Wyatt Year of the Spider Time Out of Mind Once More, With Feeling (Buffy episode) Real Love (song) Avenue Q Atomism Earth Girl Arjuna Pain The Subtle Knife Nineteen Eighty-Four One Tree Hill (TV series) Angel Sanctuary Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Kodocha EastEnders Nothing E 1999 Eternal The Daleks' Master Plan Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Sex and the City Samurai Deeper Kyo The Dalek Invasion of Earth Pitaten Milton H.
