contacts im gunna get contacts in a few days and i was wondering do u have too get use to them i mean like where they for hrs one day and stuff like that usually there is a break in period when you first start wearing them your eye doctor will tell you how it works but usually you start out with wearing them a certain number of hours each day and increase that by an hour or each day after that until you are wearing them for the whole day i held off for a long time in getting contacts because i never wanted to feel like there was something in my eye and i didn't like the whole notion of putting a foreign object in my eye however once i finally decided to get them i was amazed to find out that most of the time i didn't even feel them when they were in and if i did it was usually at the end of the day when it was time to take them out anyway The Amazing Race 1957 World Series Hour Social rule Shaggy dog story The Ashlee Simpson Show Milton H.
