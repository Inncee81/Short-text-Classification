eyes sensitive to light i was at a hours concert last night and now my eyes are very sensitive to light i'm sitting with the lights off now all the electrical stimualtion of being at a concert makes your brain more sensitive to light as well as being confined to a darker than normal area for so long your eyes were for accustomed to the low low lighting and the brighter flashes of light from the concert so now you are having to re adjust to the normal light source which is way way more than what your eyes were previously accustomed to relax give your eyes and your brain time to heal stay out of the bright lights and gradually add more light into your day and see if the sensitivity eases up if it's still bad after days go to the eye doctor to make sure you havent permanently damaged your retinas Color blindness Eye Color Sun Diabetic retinopathy Bicycle lighting Retina Night vision Light-emitting diode Pupil Incandescent light bulb Ultraviolet Chlorpromazine Explosive material Street light Solar eclipse Transformer Electroencephalography Cat Fluoroscopy Autostereogram Extraterrestrial skies Sleep Radiation hardening Fluorescent lamp Light Urinary incontinence Nuclear explosion Sento Retinal detachment Apparent magnitude Tuatara Tocopherol Loudspeaker Binocular rivalry Magnetic resonance imaging Laser applications Insomnia CIE 1931 color space Color vision Glasses Eye color Red dot sight Seismometer Insulin Red-eye effect Welding Lighting Mercury Atlas 6 X-ray Albinism Clinical depression Hearing impairment Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Chronic fatigue syndrome Radiation therapy Stereoscopy Solar cell Eyeglass prescription Gamma ray burst Out-of-body experience Philosophy of perception Decibel Milton H.
