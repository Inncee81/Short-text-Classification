need some help with contacts ok i know there are tons of questions about contacts on here but i need some help alright well i have had contacts now for a little over a month and i know i should be having no trouble putting them on but when i always do i end up poking my eyes i know i can open my eyes up but the lids always blink i've tried almost everything suggested looking into a mirror looking up etc but i really need help about the poking my eye part it hurts pretty bad and also when i try to put them on i always tear up and can't stop is there anything that can help with this also legitimate answers will be appreciated thanks it takes time and lots of patience don't be in a hurry when you do it make sure that the tip of your finger is dry when you place the lense on it also be sure too that the lense is not inside out the edge should be round and straight up just place the lense on the tip of your index finger i do my right first barely touch your eye and it should slip right on in blink slowly and there you go i always use a few drops to moisten my eyes after i put the lense in too just remember not to be in a hurry cause it will only take you longer and you will get frustrated with yourself believe me its much better than wearing glasses good luck Social rule Eye The Shining (film) Fast bowling 2000 Australian Grand Prix Conjunctivitis Sunglasses Condom Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Aerial (dance move) Electrophysiology Stereoscopy Shen Gong Wu Knife Fencing Eyepiece Violin Volleyball Glasses Shaggy dog story Milton H.
