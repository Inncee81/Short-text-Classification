eye problem for the past several weeks my eyes have been getting red on and off i wear contacts and the redness occurs after i wear my contacts for several days i take them out at night i don't wear my contacts while my eyes are red and ive tried changing them but that is not the problem my eyes get irrated it feels like something is in them they sometimes get watery and sometimes they are a little sensitive to light at the beginning of the summer had an abrhasion in my right eye and my doctor gave me eye drops systane at first i thought the abrhasion never healed all the way but it keeps happening the drops seem to help with the pain but i wanted to know if anyone knew what was happening before i go to the eye doctor again oh yea ive been away at college so it may have to do with the change of scenery please if anyone has any help i would greatly appreciate it thanks the abrasion isn't healing probably because the lens won't allow for sufficient oxygen or to get to the epithelium long enough to replace the basement membrane this membrane can be damaged with an abrasion the epithelial cells will grow over the wound but without the basement membrane to adhere to they can get bumped off fairly easily you might try not wearing your lenses for about weeks this'll give your corneas enough time to heal sort of get back to normal then try your lenses again you might also have a sensitivity to the solutions you use for your lenses or something in them a preservative cleaning solution make sure that if you do have an abrasion that it's a simple abrasion and not an infection i think the eyes have control of us here have you noticed how many questions are about contacts if eyes took a vote would they allow contacts at all both my eyes said no thanks but i've thousands of patients who's eyes say no big thing when they complain listen Contact lens Cornea Wound healing phases Eye Conjunctivitis Iris (anatomy) Epithelium Stomach cancer Diabetic retinopathy Refractive surgery Intraocular lens Diabetes mellitus Healing Photorefractive keratectomy Gonorrhoea Social rule Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Psoriasis Radiation therapy Sun Insulin Bruise Milton H.
