why do people say cross eyed people make them uncomfortable i have crossed eyes the eye i'm not using will always cross inward some people say they never know what i'm looking at and eye contact is uncomfortable is this true i would think people would focus on the eye that is looking at them if i'm talking to you why would you focus on the eye that is looking at my nose i can't help my eye condition so work with me you know my girlfriend's sister has one lazy eye i know that when i talk to her i switch between both eyes to look at it is a little odd at first to get used to but only because it is different than most can truly understand but with the idea that people would focus on the one that is looking at them not always true i know that i personally can never remember which eye is the straight eye and which one is crossed wrong but when i think the eye that is looking away is the good one that makes eye contact uncomfortable after a while because i feel like im talking to some who doesnt care about what i have to say but then i see the other eye looking at me again trained myself to switch between then i feel better and no longer have the uneasy feelings some people just take longer to adjust than others Social rule Theory of conduct Sunglasses Stereoscopy Ethics Human sexual behavior Milton H.
