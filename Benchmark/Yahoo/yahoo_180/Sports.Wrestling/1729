tna improvments wwe improvments please answer both non biased tna drug policy less cheesy wrestlers have depth more organized matches more promoting have big storyline every once in a while like vince's child more fast pace wwe less focusing everything on one wrestler like john cena or batista and more pushing all characters less jobbers realistic fueds and matches using things that happen in life out of the box storylines less vs stuff take out ecw and morph it into raw and smackdown bring back original ecw the star i noticed that have you noticed this is improvments reports are saying that tna morale is way down ratings aren't holding they feel they have no money to compete with wwe which is true they feel they can't go after ultimate fighter without lookin fake which is also true and i'll add a personal one the time slot sucks monkey balls i am a hardcore tna fan and i can never catch it i have to get up at am and there's no way i'm getting penalized it's not what you think for being late because of wrestling call me crazy but in my mind i feel things are not that bad i think if i was given full creative control i can save tna i would follow these steps demand a better timeslot and a different lead in move ultimate fighter to wednesdays or tna to wednesday but at pm with hours of programing that's the only way this show can grow get the f k out of the impact zone it looks so bush league im sick of it and im so f'ing sick of seeing the same place every week even the ppvs feel like weekly programs and that sucks which leads to my next point tour nationally i don't know what the hell ios tnas problem with their promoters lisence that they need to pimp their wrestlers out to other promotions in other to book somewhere else but resolve this matter and resolve it now this is a good source of income that is being lost and also you can grow many adepts by presenting them a live show in their hometown i don't think house shows will bomb if they are brought in after the timeslot change the tv exposure gives them national wide recognition stop the wwe jabs really makes them look like bitter bitches stop it and trust yourself talent means talent it might be time to try a little of wwes revolving door policy get rid of the jobbers quick you can run a company without obvious enhancement talent there a lot of turds in tna they need to keep their hand in the pulse of wrestling put ehir ear to the ground and bring in the guys that are making waves in the indy scene american dragon super dragon colt cabana i think he has a develop deal with wwe not sure chris hero necro butcher are guys that are making waves in the indy scene and have inate followings that would enhance the tna brand also look internationally guys from toryumon like dragon kid and guys like niguel mcguiness are people that would bring unique character to the brand also i will never forgive tna for losing cm punk since tna is starting to look monotonous this also leads me to the next point exclusive contracts right now tna looks like showcase of the indies you need to ink these guys to exclusive tna contracts you can't have your top talent like chistopher daniels working a chikara pro card or that weird new jack card you need to give people a reason to go your shows get these guys exclusive raid the independents and get them to exclusive contracts it worked for vince mcmahon why do you think vener gagne is in the wwe hof because he let mcmahon steal hulk hogan from him they need to get on par which leads to my next point get some legends in on the brand sting was a good start but a costly move they need a ratio of about percent new guys percent old guys but good old guys not jake the snake or lex luger get rid of the prima donnas like nash guys like him will always think tey are above the brand brind in good workers and please sign bret hart i don't know what you have to do to get him just do get bret hart on tna and tna will change forever this is realist move i would've said bring in stone cold but he's so tied up to wwe because of the movie deals and copyrights that it would be expensive even if he was the biggest attitude era star i dont know what they have to do but bring guys that people loved and get some casual fans back bring jericho in they already missed out on benoit who's now tied forever to wwe and do not cater to prima donnas like nash or the possibly returning scott hall i don't pretend these wrestlers to wreslter full time maybe manage or something to that effect get rid of larry zabisko he's not relevant anymore you are big game now start acting like it there's something about the way the tna shows go that stinks of indy wrestling they need to separate themselves they need to stop looking bush league with moves like losing sabu and moore and jeff hardy to wwe also stop looking like the land of the wcw rejects stop copying wcw wcw was good for a while but it is dead now so start acting like a new brand and a different brand at that which leads to create a firm identity i mean we have indy style wrestling with clear finishes and then we have a barbed wire match and then a full on sports entertainment match with jeff jarret cheating that pissed my dad off after watching samoa joe i mention this because he's a casual fan and he liked it because of the clean finishes and the main event came and it was a full on sports entertainment match full of interferences this was the match where christian beat jarret for the title so establish what is your niche and run with it if you are the alternative act like an alternative and not a cheap knockoff jeff jarret polygraph test i mean what the f k didn't wwe do this angle with mcmahon and mr america already some of these sports entertainment storylines are not good at all which leads too really put your mind into the angles all of last year i thought an angle was being set up for samoa joe chase for the nwa title a la warrior where he would in x division champion and then face jarrett but they backtracked to sting and joe was limboed the team d vs amw feud was left inconclusive and recently lax helped the james gang in a match so try to keep in mind the angles thera is alot of talent without angles right now just going out there and wrestling
