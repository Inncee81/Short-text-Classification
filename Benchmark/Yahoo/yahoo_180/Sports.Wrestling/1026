why not why wouldnt the wwe take back brock lesnar after he left to try out for minnesota vikings hes really good and they need good wrestlers well i have to say that lesnar wasn't exactly a fan favorite from what i read awhile back lesnar was at the end of his contract and the fans weren't embracing him very well it's a popularity contest in the wwe so the wwe released him after trying out with the vikings and not making the team he was i heard was wrestling i just read that he defeated kurt angle to win a championship over there in japan but i guess it's really up to vince mcmahon who he wants working for him in his company Brock Lesnar WWE Championship Kurt Angle Bill Goldberg John Cena Paul Wight Paul Levesque Mark Calaway Shelton Benjamin Chris Benoit Stone Cold Steve Austin WCW World Heavyweight Championship King of the Ring WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
