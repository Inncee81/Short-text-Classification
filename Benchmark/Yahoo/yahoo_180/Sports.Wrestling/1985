is john cena really as bad as we all think he is well most of us think so anyway i've not been a big cena supporter but it just seems like he's being bashed at times for things that aren't really his fault his gimmick which i hope changes soon one of these things he has improved a bit in the ring this year see his matches against umaga at the royal rumble his two instant classics with hbk and will hopefully finally drop the title at or soon after summerslam so tell me is he getting any better to anyone besides me no it's not really cena the wrestler it's cena the character that everyone hates technically he's a good wrestler but his gimmick from gangsta rapper to a marine with some hip hop flavor is really annoying and despite what you say he does have some control over that hes the champion for goodness sake he has some input in his character but mainly i believe people don't like him more so than usual for the simple fact that he's been champion for way too long it's no longer fun what's the point of watching a ppv when in my head i'm thinking why am i watching this i already know cena's going to win the suspense is gone John Cena Shawn Michaels Hulk Hogan Carly Colon John Layfield Mark Calaway Kurt Angle Eddie Guerrero World Championship Wrestling Jason Reso Stone Cold Steve Austin Glen Jacobs Chris Jericho Bret Hart Professional wrestling match types Paul Levesque Mark Copani Page Falkenberg Greg Valentine King of the Ring Chris Benoit Randy Savage Taboo Tuesday Paul Wight Rodney Anoai Leon White Vince McMahon Orlando Jordan Gimmick (professional wrestling) WrestleMania 21 Professional wrestling attacks Jon Heidenreich Warrior (wrestler) Extreme Championship Wrestling Matt Hardy Solofa Fatu Mick Foley Adam Copeland Ric Flair Professional wrestling slang Lex Luger David Bautista Amy Dumas The Rock (entertainer) Michael Hayes (wrestler) Randy Orton World Wrestling Entertainment Jim Duggan Shoot (professional wrestling) Music in professional wrestling Ted DiBiase Professional wrestling throws Gregory Helms Bob Backlund SummerSlam WWE RAW The Great American Bash WWE Vengeance WWE United States Championship Montreal Screwjob Nelson Frazier, Jr. Peter Senerca Sting (wrestler) Owen Hart Mike Bucci Gangsta rap Ren__ Goguen WWE Unforgiven Ron Killings NWo Tag team BG James In Your House Kevin Nash Hip hop collaborations Scott Levy WWE No Mercy WWE Armageddon Oscar Gutierrez Ring of Honor World Class Championship Wrestling Amateur wrestling Brian Kendrick WWE Judgment Day WWE Draft Four Horsemen (professional wrestling) Juventud Guerrera WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
