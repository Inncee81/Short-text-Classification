worst and best finisher ever in wwe wwf history what do u think plz star i have to agree with those that say the f is the best in wwe history the five star frog splash would be up there except it has been watered down a bit by the wwe in ecw the ring had more bounce and was a bit smaller so it made the impact look much better than in the wwe also i would say billy kidman's shooting star press would be up there but after watching many guys including brock lesnar do it it just became a regular move as for worst finisher in history i would say its the goon's bodycheck if you are looking for a somewhat big name i would say its probably the masterlock its a full nelson from a strong guy anyone over and the move looks really weak Professional wrestling throws Professional wrestling aerial techniques Eddie Guerrero Kurt Angle Brock Lesnar WWE No Mercy Professional wrestling slang Shooting star press WWE Vengeance Mike Alfonso Paul London King of the Ring Peter Gruner John Cena Royal Rumble WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
