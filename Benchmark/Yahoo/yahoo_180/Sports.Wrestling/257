gregory helms do u see him ever returning to his hurricane gimmick i think it would be awesome if he could but since the whole wrestling entertainment has a story line that they had to follow i don't think wrestling would allow the sudden change any time soon just look at the whole benoit situation because of his death vince mcmahon had to come out and show that he didnt die yesterday night he tried to cover it up with saying that he wanted to know if people really cared they made him say that hoping that it would flow in with mr mcmahons sneaky personality and gel with the srory line but it didn't fit exactly and if gregory helms changes his persona again they are going to have to mix up another cheezy cover up lol gregory helms is way too serious of a character to go back to a comic book super hero Gregory Helms Glen Jacobs Hurricane and Rosey World Championship Wrestling Vince McMahon Ric Flair Chris Benoit Kurt Angle Gimmick (professional wrestling) Extreme Championship Wrestling Mark Calaway World Wrestling Entertainment Stone Cold Steve Austin Owen Hart Warrior (wrestler) WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
