who will be the next roh world champion takeshi morishima has held the strap since february of this year but what i am curious about is who do you guys think will be the man to finally bring him down and take the gold nigel mcguinness's name has been thrown around a lot as the next world champ if he gets a title shot the next time they're in england he should be the favorite to win a lot of people also believe that bryan danielson could win becoming the first two time champ in roh history those are the two most likely to be the next roh champion i'd also give austin aries brent albright claudio castignoli chris hero possibilities to win as well homicide samoa joe won't be the next champ as they can't work for roh while still being in tna unless they move they're not getting the roh world title anytime soon Bryan Danielson Phil Brooks A.J.
