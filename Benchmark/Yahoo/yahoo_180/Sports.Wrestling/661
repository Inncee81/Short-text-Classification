is all wrestling crap now a days i think wwe is a fuc king joke its so gay predictble and retarted there a disgrace to what wwf was i do like tna but there far from perfect they got loads of problems as well do you think wrestling will ever be as good as it used to be like the days of wcw wwf and the orignal ecw tna is the closest thing to competition we have to the wwe nowadays but i agree wrestling in general as a whole isn't like it used to be but it might be if tna gets big if that happens then there might be another monday night wars or of roh gets big also then it could be a way war basically if wrestling were to go back to the way it was then different people need to support the other brand besides wwe support ring of honer support tna support mr carlos' japenese promotions the more brands out there the more competition and that will also force the wwe to get where it should be then wrestling in general will be great again World Wrestling Entertainment Extreme Championship Wrestling Total Nonstop Action Wrestling WWE RAW World Championship Wrestling Vince McMahon Peter Senerca NWo WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
