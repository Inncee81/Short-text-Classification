why should i take the wwe seriusly anymore the wwe is becoming a children's wrestling show there used to be complicated stories with plot twists there used to be great matches right now the stories resemble cartoons people like cena or batista are the superheroes and guys like edge or ortan portray the evil villians the plots are stale as cardboard why do serious intelligent fans buy into this tna is a real wrestling show originaly the wwe was intended to entertain the younger crowd but as the years went buy the younger people grew older but they kept on watching because it became addicting to them mainly because it is storylined people had to tune in the following week just to see what would happen next then before they new it they where years old do you remember the nwo now that was some good acting with good storylines Eddie Guerrero NWo Shawn Michaels Professional wrestling Hulk Hogan World Wrestling Entertainment WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
