does your life depend on saying wwe is fake to other wwe fans i keep seeing the same questions over and over again it seems to me that anti wrestling fans are trying to change the minds of wwe fans why are they wasting their time they don't have jobs to go to i like do i'm just doing this before i leave for work my life doesnt going around the wwe i only watch raw and i do watch tna i'm not even sure if it's even fake or not i've heard it's fake it's not fake and some of it is fake but i know what you mean i'm so so sick of ppl telling wwe fans that it's fake and if it is let us enjoy it Scott Levy Matt Hardy World Wrestling Entertainment Diva (professional wrestling) Glen Jacobs WWE Friday Night SmackDown!
