tonight pooh piglet will put burger king big mac in their place the winner of course will face roger clemens barry bonds for their wwe tag team championships brb tonight will be a night everybody especially big bird will never forget we begin the night with theodore facing spiderpig it was a great match spiderpig was dominating the entire match he had theodore down and he went to the top rope he was waiting for theodore to get up to hit a clothline but before he got a chance to do so simon came out and pushed him off getting theodore dq d but they didn t care as the continued to beat on him they got a table and set it up just as alvin wendy came out wendy hit spiderpig with a chair to get him on the table the alvin hit a splash on him to break the table dave savill porky came out to chase them away but it was too late beatdown tag champs pooh piglet faced burger king big mac in a non title match it was an intense match pooh piglet were just about to win pooh hit a suckel punch piglet hit a big pig kick on burger king brb piglet pinned king but before the ref counted to he was pulled out by barry bonds he knocked out the ref with a baseball bat then roger clemens came from behind and hit pooh piglet with his tag team belt barry bonds did the same to king mac they left as both teams were knocked out the next match pitted courage vs comic book guy comic book guy was dominating the whole match due to his size he had courage in the corner and ran right into him he then went to the top rope courage got up and he jumped to hit a body slam but courage caught him by the throat he then hit a choke bone for the win he gat a mic and said tony the tiger i want that ecw championship and because i am a fair person i think it s only fair that i have a rematch with jabba before i face you but i think this time i think i m prepared for that fat piece of sh that you call jabba the hutt and when i beat him i ll win that title at fantasy summerslam brb he was about to leave when jabba came from behind and attacked him he was about to hit a chokeslamk on courag but courage kicked him and turned it into a choke bone he left with jabbba layed out it was the main event as garfield once again put his title on the line big bird came out and walked to the ring but as he walked in king arty came from behind making it a way but no one knew so he turned garfield hit the excalib ur on him he did the same to big bird he pinned bird right away jong tried to come in but he was too late as the ref got to before he got in arty quickly got up and hit the exclaib ur on him as well he got a mic and said finally i got this prestigious belt after all my pain and suffering to get to the top i am here and the view is nothing less than i expected but now garfield i believe we can finally come to a compromise on the situation with the compan before he could finish big bird hit him with the fork brb he hit him over and over with the fork in the head security finally got him out of there after he left the ref checked on the new champ but then garfield pushed the ref out of the way and pinned arty he yealled ring the bell to start the match or i m firing you sorry a the ref reluctantly had top do so and counted to to crown garfield the new champ he grabbed the mic from arty s lifeless hands and yelled how was the top oh i forgot to tell you you have to watch your step because you can quickly fall off you will never get this title off my waist unless of course you pry it from my cold dead hands but like you could do any damage to me long story short you will never top me in the ladde r of nkk now i ll take this back and leave you here to suffer he leaves wit jong his title as arty lays lifeless in the ring hope you enjoyed this is just for fun if you
