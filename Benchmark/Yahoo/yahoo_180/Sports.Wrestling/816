isnt it fairly obvious who the 'other' mcmahon is mr kennedy he was supposed to get a push during the 'death' angle and that fell apart vince comes back with another 'suprise' kennedy isnt involved in the ic title or wwe title match at summerslam so im guessing this will develop his character and plus vince's middle name is kennedy your thoughts damn it this question was posted minute after 'rated rko king of kings' posted his wow that really makes sense and remember when mr mcmahon was dead and kennedy came out and cut a promo saying everything he did from that day forward would be dedicated to the legacy of mr mcmahon or something like that this should be really interesting watching how it all unfolds Vince McMahon Paul Levesque Kurt Angle Hulk Hogan Professional wrestling slang Mark Calaway World Wrestling Entertainment Montreal Screwjob Stephanie McMahon-Levesque The Rock (entertainer) Chris Jericho Glen Jacobs WWE Championship Randy Orton Shane McMahon Shoot (professional wrestling) Booker Huffman Professional wrestling King of the Ring Darren Matthews Eddie Guerrero John Cena Ric Flair Trish Stratus Royal Rumble SummerSlam ECW One Night Stand WWE No Mercy WWE RAW Brothers of Destruction The Invasion NWo Chris Benoit Greg Valentine WWE Judgment Day World Championship Wrestling John Layfield Jim Ross WWE Vengeance Professional wrestling match types Matt Hardy Joanie Laurer Eric Bischoff World Tag-Team Championship In Your House WCW Monday Nitro Linda McMahon Bob Backlund Virgil Runnels III Paul Wight WWE Homecoming Warrior (wrestler) Professional wrestling throws Page Falkenberg The Alliance John F.
