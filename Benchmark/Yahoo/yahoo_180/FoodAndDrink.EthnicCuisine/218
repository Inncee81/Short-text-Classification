what is the difference in flavor between vegemite and marmite i've had vegemite a couple of times a friend of mine gave me a bottle of it after a trip to oz and boy was it salty x p we yanks aren't used to that at least i'm not i did dissolve it into water to steam veggies with and as soup base it would be good it's straight up that's hard for me to handle i saw marmite in the grocery store a couple of months ago and was hesitant to buy it but still curious does it taste the same as vegemite is it different if so how so thank you all for the details much appreciated a friend of mine from oz was visiting she was in my kitchen while i whipped out the vegemite she told me how to eat it just a thin scraping with butter on toasted bread i did as she said and she was there to watch too but even then x p ooo better i use that as soup base now i wanna try both side by side just a tiny dab at full power and also diluted in water i'm australian and i have to say i prefer vegemite i love it on toast anyway getting back to your question i find marmite a little bit tangy compared to vegemite they both are very strong flavoured i always recommend to people who don't like it to maybe put a tiny scraping of vegemite on toast or a sandwich i think sometimes people use too much for their first try and get put off and margarine or butter must be used this is very important people and i can't stress that enough lol vegemite is so thick and it tastes too strong on bread on it's own i use vegemite in soup bases and it is good for that Marmite Bread Vegemite Breakfast Cuisine of Denmark Japanese cuisine Peanut butter Sandwich Ramen Bovril Tofu Cha chaan teng Toast Cuisine of the Philippines Tea Australian cuisine Pizza German cuisine Soup Bagel Sushi Hot dog Barbecue Shaggy dog story Vegetarian cuisine Korean cuisine French toast Jewish cuisine Beer Coffee Milk Natt__ Rum Pea soup Hamburger Mattress British cuisine Cuisine of Brazil Cuisine of Singapore Bengali cuisine Honey Asparagus Margarine Chili con carne Basic taste Peanut RuneScape quests Datalore (TNG episode) Miso soup Sydney Riot of 1879 Singlish Toaster Brewery Vodka Chowder Dairy Tea (meal) Seinfeld Joke Butter Cookware and bakeware Coriander Vegetarianism Maple syrup Cocoa Cuisine of the Southern United States Hamster Gumbo Japanese tea ceremony Brazing Nutmeg Peanut butter and jelly sandwich Red Dwarf characters Ice cream Alcoholic beverage Equine conformation Hot pot Serial comma Little Britain Cantonese cuisine Potato Full English breakfast Halva Laksa Cheese Olive oil D__ner kebab Yerba mate Cajun cuisine Oyster Porridge Risotto Ketchup
