who think andrew bynum is actually good well he did put up up some impressive games with the lakers but is he really good is he really worth keepin around and waiting until he reaches his prime while wasting away the best player in the game's prime in the process phil jackson himself said he's not impressed with his work ethic especially on defense he doesn't feel bynum can move his feet well problems similar to shaq where he wouldn't help out on screen and rolls what do you guys think yo i read a lot of your posts i know how you think socks is weak because hes a strictly back to the basket type center and he'll never develop to compete against the stoudemires of this league that said regardless of his downward spiral at the end of last season i think the kid has a lot of upside its just his intangibles that come to question the kid just doesnt show heart if its enough for your coach to question your work ethic it becomes pretty clear that ur desire to win becomes questionable plus socks has the best mentor guiding him to brilliance right now its all up in the air man judging from his past season he has shown that he is improving and adjusting to the nba if u remember the jermaine o neils and al jeffersons and how long it took them to develop then theres reason to believe that bynum has the potential to hit that caliber its just a matter of does he have the desire to get there his one time display of heart was when he pushed shaq and dunked on him can he consistently be as aggressive as then i also think the lakers didnt play bynum in the summer league so that he wouldnt diminish his trade value by either a getting injured or b getting schooled by bottomdweller d leaguers in front of scouts i also think the organization is so hesitant to move bynum because of how much they've invested into him they started out garnishing extreme interest by opposing teams and now its all simmered down because his hype and playoff performance has killed his value what should the lakers do with the guy stand pat or sell sell sell University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Basketball University of North Carolina at Charlotte Bobby Knight Atlantic Coast Conference Wake Forest University 2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament Duke University National Invitation Tournament Sam Barry National Basketball Association New Mexico Lobo Basketball John Calipari Ron and Fez Mike Krzyzewski Syracuse University Orange Jeff Mullins Big Brother (USA TV series) Football chant Michael Jordan University of San Francisco Wayne Simien New York Giants Neighbours The Dukes of Hazzard San Antonio Spurs Adolph Rupp College basketball Continental Basketball Association Freedom Hall Auburn University John R.
