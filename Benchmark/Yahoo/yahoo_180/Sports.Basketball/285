celtics comeback with the addition of ray allen and kevin garnett and the presence of paul pierce will the celtics finally stop sucking and restore their former glory i'm currently a spurs fan but i was a celtic fan during the bird era the acquisition of kg allen definitely helps but they will take time to gel maybe they will struggle in the early part of the season in terms of sucking they will definitely stop doing that in fact they will not even be remotely in the vicinity of sucking they'll be closer to the contender zip code three perennial all stars who are all known to be unselfish will guarantee a playoff spot in the relatively easy east maybe even a top seed once the celtics are in the playoffs don't be surprised if they have a deep run maybe even get into the finals if they get lucky but ultimately the nba champion will come from the west most probably the defending champion spurs Toronto Blue Jays 1986 NBA Draft NASCAR Rookie of the Year Toronto Raptors Yao Ming Pittsburgh Steelers Chicago Bulls Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Clippers Carolina Panthers New England Patriots Indiana Pacers National Basketball Association Orlando Magic Seattle Mariners New York Giants 2005 World Series San Francisco 49ers The Sporting News Rookie of the Year Award Minnesota Timberwolves Houston Rockets 1984 NBA Draft Boston Bruins Greg Maddux Starting pitcher Liverpool F.C.
