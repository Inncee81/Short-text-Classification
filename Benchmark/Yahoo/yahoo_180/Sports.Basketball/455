what do you think of this trade way trade http games espn go com nba features traderesult players teams te cash wow this is probably one of the greatest trades posted up here each of the important players that are traded on each team either want out or the team wants them out so that works out well the only problem is i doubt the nets would give up marcus williams they gave up eddie house to the celtics and now they won't have a legitimate backup point guard for jason kidd he's also a great player who is supposed to blossom into a beautiful pg with the mentoring of jason kidd of course i think indiana would definitely accept this trade because they obviously need to get rid of jo before he simply becomes a free agent and they get nobody for him now that i think about it the nets would most likely also accept because carter made a statement about how he would love jo on the nets and the organization needs to give up future players to possibly get to the finals like the celtics did the clippers would probably be the happiest with this trade because they git rid of maggette and everyone knows he's not wanted there kristic would also fill the void for the injured brand good trade Toronto Raptors Yao Ming New York Knicks Minnesota Timberwolves National Basketball Association 1986 NBA Draft Rasheed Wallace NBA Finals Chicago Bulls Julius Erving Norway national football team Utah Jazz January 2005 in sports Basketball Los Angeles Clippers San Antonio Spurs Cincinnati Bengals Houston Rockets New York Giants Toronto Blue Jays Michael Jordan 2005 NBA Finals Larry Bird New Jersey Nets New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Orlando Magic LeBron James San Francisco 49ers Wilt Chamberlain Luther Head National Football League Cliff Robinson (basketball player born 1966) Minor league baseball Jerry Lucas David Robinson (basketball player) Cleveland Browns Buffalo Bills Super Bowl V Pittsburgh Penguins Continental Basketball Association Volleyball New Mexico Lobo Basketball Allen Iverson New England Patriots Magic Johnson St. Louis Rams Emanuel Gin__bili Water polo International League Moses Malone November 2004 in sports Mario Lemieux December 2004 in sports Tim Duncan Boston Bruins Super Bowl XXXIV Phoenix Suns Jerry Krause Portland Trail Blazers Ben Wallace Dirk Nowitzki Indianapolis 500 Super Bowl IX Dikembe Mutombo American football strategy Scottie Pippen Syracuse University Orange Montreal Canadiens Chick Hearn Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Indiana Pacers Glossary of American football 1977 NBA Finals Kevin McHale Philadelphia 76ers Danny Manning 1957 World Series NBA Draft Football (soccer) positions June 2004 in sports Super Bowl XIII George Mikan Women's National Basketball Association Amare Stoudemire Arkansas Razorbacks Buck Williams Rick Barry Detroit Red Wings Miami Dolphins Eddy Curry
