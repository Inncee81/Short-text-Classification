is there any catholic nba players probably a number possibly who were or still are active catholics eva longoria said that both she and tony parker are from catholic families you can tell who wears the pants in that family but it is naturally part of the mexican culture for those of mexican ancestry that the woman runs the family so whatever eva tells the media tony parker just has to keep his mouth shut and not dispute i do think that with eva starting to date a year old boy in tony parker has made tony parker into more of a man an example is that starting spurs point guard tony parker spent the entire fourth quarter of the close out game of the nba finals on the bench while after starting to date eva longoria tony parker has seemed to have grown seemingly a lot under the influence of eva and played in the and nba finals close out game fourth quarters although in in the fourth quarter as the spurs started out the first minutes of the close out game scoreless it was finally tim duncan who scored straight points to get the spurs on the scoreboard in the fourth quarter of the nba finals closeout game and then the argentinians two of the big three argentinians from their gold medal team took over with the argentenians ginobili and oberto scoring of the last spurs points in that fourth quarter where the spurs only scored points to win that game by point i am not so sure about tony parker being catholic although eva may have made him convert to catholicism but he could be with his chicago born and raised father and his dutch born and raised mother where in neither situation would there be a high probability of parker ever being a catholic unfortunately in france typically adult men have not seen the inside of a catholic church for probably most of the last century and in all of those beautiful french cathedrals are empty on sundays much of continental europe with the exception of small pockets like bavaria in germany germans consider bavarians like americans consider people from the state of mississippi or so i was told by a native bavarian no longer has much of an active catholic adult community as the active catholic adult communities are in the americas africa and the philippines for the most part but i am sure that there are faithful catholic adults in almost every community in the world but europe was once catholic which is now almost nothing the late atlanta hawks player jason collier went to catholic central high school in springfield ohio but that does not mean that he was catholic as many non catholics particularly athletes attend catholic high schools San Antonio Spurs Tony Parker NBA Finals Chicago Bulls 2005 NBA Finals Emanuel Gin__bili January 2005 in sports New York Knicks Dream Team Rasheed Wallace Pittsburgh Steelers American football Tim Duncan Steve Nash Indiana Pacers David Robinson (basketball player) Michael Jordan Larry Bird San Francisco 49ers National Basketball Association Orlando Magic 1986 NBA Draft New York Giants Los Angeles Clippers World Series 2005 World Series Football (soccer) 2004 World Series Alex Ferguson Yao Ming United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics New England Patriots Satchel Paige Winter Olympic Games Toronto Raptors Minnesota Timberwolves International League Norway national football team Iron Bowl Continental Basketball Association Illinois Utah Jazz Volleyball Hispanic February 2005 in sports Robert Horry Dennis Rodman June 2004 in sports Denver Nuggets Allen Iverson Steffi Graf Poker jargon Cleveland Browns November 2004 in sports Boxing Carolina Panthers Houston Rockets Basketball at the 2004 Summer Olympics Oakland Athletics Andre Agassi Pete Rose Arizona State University Super Bowl XXXIII Luther Head Moses Malone July 2004 in sports NBA Draft October 4 in baseball Al Michaels Roger Federer Atlanta Hawks Chicago Blackhawks Cincinnati Bengals NCAA football bowl games, 2004-05 Carlos Arroyo Betting (poker) San Antonio, Texas American football strategy 1957 World Series October 16 in baseball 2004 American League Championship Series College basketball Detroit Pistons Wilt Chamberlain National Football League Lore German language Pinball Water polo Sandy Koufax 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup
