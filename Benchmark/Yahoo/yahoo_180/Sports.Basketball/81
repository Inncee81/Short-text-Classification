i am a year old female and i want to become a women's college basketball coach right now i am in high school and i want to get some training in becoming a coach i want to learn the aspects of coaching and all the other things that come with it i do assist my dad in coaching his basketball team but that is just a youth league where can learn to coach i'll even accept web pages that show how to teach coaching i appreciate all who can answer thank you one thing you should do is approach the coaches of your hs basketball teams mens and womens and tell them about your desire and ask if you can be a trainer for the team take copious notes and ask if you can have regular meetings with the coach and assistant coaches to discuss any questions and get insight on the coaching that they're doing remember most coaches people have a very busy schedule and it is difficult to add more work for them so you should approach it in a way that will make you an asset to the coach and the team to make their jobs easier offer to be the water person to help film games for the team to review later to keep stats etc most of all show them that you are dedicated by doing your homework and always arrive early it doesn't sound like you play basketball yourself which is a little bit of a setback as many coaches have playing experience but not all of them do and some of the best don't at all be a student to the game learn all the rules and strategies read as many books as you can and get real team experience read this site for a lot of great info too http www guidetocoachingbasketball com good luck National Basketball Association Baseball Basketball Extreme Programming Theory of conduct New York Knicks National Football League Volleyball Social rule Continental Basketball Association Women's National Basketball Association A Course In Miracles Georgia Institute of Technology New Mexico Lobo Basketball Los Angeles Kings Larry Bird Arizona State University Game programmer Southeastern Conference Los Angeles Clippers GED University of San Francisco College basketball Quizbowl Troms__ I.L.
