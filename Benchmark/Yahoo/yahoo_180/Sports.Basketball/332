if the lakers made a trade for jo would it have to include lamar odom just wondering because i really like him as a laker but the lakers need to do what ever it takes at this point moneys but a th or th seed is where they were last year i think jo would make a bigger impact then that right now i'm not sure odom has a pretty decent sized contract he also wouldn't fall into the youth movement the pacers are looking at right now although he does give them a vet for granger to play aside i'm not sure but either way bynum is for sure to be in the trade deal the lakers might get pressured in the deal because of kobe wanting change but personally o'neal isn't worth bynum and odom this isn't garnett we're talking about jermaine o'neal is a good player but nothing like his mvp like season in ' he also gets injured a lot hopefully kobe knows that and doesn't pressure them Allen Iverson Shaquille O'Neal Yao Ming Dream Team NBA Finals Tim Duncan Denver Nuggets Michael Jordan LeBron James NBA Draft Chicago Bulls January 2005 in sports Kobe Bryant Basketball December 2004 in sports National Basketball Association Orlando Magic Philadelphia 76ers Amare Stoudemire San Antonio Spurs New York Knicks NBA Rookie of the Year Award Emanuel Gin__bili David Robinson (basketball player) 2005 NBA Finals November 2004 in sports New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics Robert Horry Karl Malone 1986 NBA Draft Portland Trail Blazers Phil Jackson Ben Wallace Oscar Robertson Dirk Nowitzki College basketball Utah Jazz Dikembe Mutombo Los Angeles Clippers Larry Bird Vince Carter Tim Hardaway June 2004 in sports Jermaine O'Neal Volleyball 2004 NBA Finals Chuck Cooper Damon Stoudamire Kenyon Martin New Jersey Nets Kevin Garnett Slam Dunk Contest Luther Head Andrew Bogut Continental Basketball Association Derek Fisher Center (basketball) Steve Kerr Gary Payton (basketball) Charles Barkley NBA Slam Dunk Contest Indiana Pacers Tayshaun Prince Minnesota Timberwolves Jason Kidd Jerry West Ben Gordon Rasheed Wallace Jerry Lucas Three-point field goal July 2004 in sports Tracy McGrady February 2005 in sports Cleveland Cavaliers Katelyn Faber Tony Parker Wilt Chamberlain June 2005 in sports Golden State Warriors Julius Erving Detroit Pistons Punk'd Women's National Basketball Association SLAM Magazine Pat Garrity Snooker Dwyane Wade Atlanta Hawks New York Giants 1990s Danny Ainge Chauncey Billups Moses Malone
