who is better gerald wallace or josh smith who do you think is better people definitely a tough choice but i would choose gerald wallace josh smith is definitely the better dunker and better post up player but wallace is less turnover prone and shoots a higher percentage defensively smith is more likely to guard the slower small forwards and some power forwards whereas wallace gets the assignment of the athletic wing players given the nba's recent rule changes that emphasizes speed and freedom of movement on the perimeter and given the recent influx of talent at the wing positions wade carmelo durant lebron etc wallace seems to be more valuable as a defender so given that wallace is more efficient offensively and has the ability to guard the wing positions defensively i would give him the nod over smith Water polo LeBron James Rasheed Wallace Volleyball Toronto Raptors NBA Finals Rugby union positions Baseball Chicago Bulls Leeds United F.C.
