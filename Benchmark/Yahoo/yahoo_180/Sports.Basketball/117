who do you think will be the better point guard in the future deron williams or chris paul i need to know every thing deron plays under a structured format in utah where every offensive defensive scheme is controlled by coach jerry sloan he has a legitimate inside threat in carlos boozer and an outside one in mehmet okur that's not a knock on deron's game because he is one hell of a competitor he can drive and finish when he needs to he can penetrator and dish it out to the open man he also can step behind the arc and nail a pointer he reminds me of a young baron davis because of their size and their style of play because deron does like to score however deron doesn't defend as well as baron or paul and doesn't get as much steals chris paul is a more slim and fast point guard in the kevin johnson isiah thomas mode where he knows how to use his basketball iq to make tough decisions on offense new orleans doesn't run a legitimate playbook like utah all the time cp is given more room to either create a shot for his teammates or himself paul is a better defender and because of his quickness he does get a lot of steals he's kind of like d wade because he doesn't like shoot 's and tends to favor shooting inside the arc or driving the basket so you can't really say out of these floor generals who is the better point guard if deron william because the next baron davis or john stockton and chris paul becomes the next isiah thomas or kevin johnson then it'll end up being a wash i think deron williams and chris paul will share the title as the top point guards in the nba in years Basketball NBA Finals Toronto Raptors Indiana Pacers Michael Jordan Dream Team New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Chicago Bulls New York Knicks Karl Malone Larry Bird Steve Nash Luther Head Three-point field goal Volleyball Carolina Panthers Continental Basketball Association Yao Ming 1986 NBA Draft Houston Rockets Super Bowl XXVII United States at the 2004 Summer Olympics December 2004 in sports 2005 NBA Finals Isiah Thomas Joe Dumars Cincinnati Bengals Water polo Pittsburgh Steelers Glossary of American football Detroit Pistons Cleveland Browns Los Angeles Clippers Minnesota Timberwolves Carlos Arroyo John Stockton Boxing Dennis Rodman San Francisco 49ers The NBA on NBC American football San Antonio Spurs Rugby union positions November 2004 in sports Buffalo Bills National Basketball Association Portland Trail Blazers Super Bowl XXIV Super Bowl XXV Kobe Bryant Super Bowl III Professional wrestling attacks Shawn Michaels The Apprentice 2 Bobby Knight Kansas City Chiefs Orlando Magic Pinball Mark Calaway Professional wrestling match types Robert Horry National Football League Lore Reggie Miller Super Bowl IX Tim Duncan Emanuel Gin__bili New England Patriots Norway national football team Table tennis National Football League 2004 NBA Finals Rasheed Wallace Jerry Sloan Super Bowl XXVI Super Bowl XIII Team Fortress Classic Cris Carter Charles Barkley St. Louis Rams Jeff Hornacek Golden State Warriors Combine (Half-Life 2) Miami Dolphins Allen Iverson New Mexico Lobo Basketball International League Resident Evil (video game) Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Magic Johnson Super Bowl XV ESPN25 Baseball Miracle on Ice
