is there a way that i can improve my ball handeling and crossovers in basketball every time i try to cross someone i either get the ball stolen or lose control of the ball so is there a way i can improve my ball handeling and improve my crossovers ball handling is like walking it has to feel natural and what you do when dribbling is all reaction in a basketball game find a basketball court and dribble two balls basketballs up and down the court one down and the other up then practice dribbling both balls up and down at the same time both balls rise and fall together this will improve coordination and timing and footwork dribbling thru your legs back and forth nonstop in a standstill position make sure your legs are spaced far enough apart to do it though improves dribbling and muscle coordination and stregnth when dribbling stand with your legs spread apart shoulder width and bounce the ball back and forth from the left to your right hand doing it as hard as you can in a crossover fashion standing still this will get your hands and feet used to how your body should be when crossing someone practice your crossover without anyone in front of you at all when you are comfortable going left and right incoorporate a human into your workout remember when dribbling the ball things are very important dribbling stregnth and footwork strength is valuable for so many reasons you say they keep stealing the ball are you nervous or telegraphing your crossover if they can read your body language then a faster set up for the xover is needed if your body is going one way and your feet another way then that explains the loosing the ball just give yourself enough room to cross the player up dont wait till they are in arms reach to start the move give yourself room to operate good luck Tim Duncan New York Knicks Basketball Philadelphia 76ers San Antonio Spurs Chicago Bulls Steve Nash National Football League Cam'ron Dikembe Mutombo 2005 NBA Finals National Basketball Association Denver Nuggets David Robinson (basketball player) NBA Finals College basketball Volleyball Women's National Basketball Association Dream Team Continental Basketball Association New York Giants Hip hop collaborations Golden State Warriors Jerry Krause Orlando Magic New Orleans/Oklahoma City Hornets Juelz Santana Babe Ruth Emanuel Gin__bili Ben Wallace Water polo Sam Barry Bobby Knight Los Angeles Clippers Utah Jazz Kobe Bryant Fort Minor Chelsea F.C.
