google video why cant i watch videos on google video certain videos south park for example will say this video is currently unavailable please try again later i turned moderate safe search is off most of the south park videos are like that why also why are videos on youtube lasting say half an hour split up into eight minute segments its stupid sombody please help me the reason that videos could currently be unavailable is because on google video it uses videos from other sites such as youtube and on youtube there are quite a few videos that get deleted and that's when that message comes up and that is because you can only upload up to minutes of video on youtube so they have to split it up into multiple segments for it to be able to be viewed on youtube Google Video Internet Relay Chat Gmail Live Aid Opportunity rover timeline for 2004 March Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Newsgroup BitTorrent Google PlayStation Portable The Star Wars Holiday Special Facebook (website) 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Slashdot subculture Everything2 Saturday Night Live Vlog Slashdot effect The Smashing Pumpkins Instant messaging U.S. Highway 101 60 Minutes DeviantART Windows Vista GameFAQs Global Positioning System Contemporary culture of South Korea Google search Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Forum moderator The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer This Is Spinal Tap DCPlusPlus Blog Machinima STS-114 Webcam Something Awful Forums Blackjack America Online USS Trigger (SS-237) Killian documents Ethernet WWE RAW Internet pornography Missingno.
