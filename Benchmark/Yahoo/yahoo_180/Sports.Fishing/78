using a fixed spool i have just started fishing with my wife we recently bought a rod and reel the reel is an lc we seem to have a problem loading it and castingm the line has been loaded we think correctly but when i go to cast it does not release it is really tight the bail arm is up i am not sure where the line is supposed to be in relation to the bail arm inside outside is it supposed to be wrapped around anything if it is on the spool the wrong way can we cahnge it around many thanks the line should come out under the bail under a little roller when the bail is closed to cast you hold the line with your right forefinger open the bail and swing the rod forwards releasing the line from your finger just before the rod is pointing straight up once you've cast out you turn the handle the bail will snap closed and you can wind the line back in if you wound the line on the spool yourself by cranking the reel it's loaded correctly assuming you put a little tension on the line if it's loose on the spool it won't work well at all also by the way spinning reels are held underneath the rod with the base between the middle and ring fingers of your right hand some beginners try to use them on top of the rod like a bait casting reel and this is awkward to say the least Fishing reel Professional wrestling holds Fly fishing Fishing rod Movie projector Professional wrestling throws Aerial (dance move) Glossary of climbing terms Wire Swingout Textile manufacturing Fast bowling Horizontal bar Lawn mower Suplex Equine conformation Anchor Timpani Knife Glossary of American football Parachute Side pass (dance move) Heckler & Koch G3 Violin Angling Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Poker jargon Harp Glossary of partner dance terms Professional wrestling attacks Guitar Double bass Revolver Car handling Internal ballistics VHS Boxing Eye Archery Strap-on dildo Hawker Hurricane Skateboarding trick Trolling for fish Connecting rod Butterfly stroke Wheel of Fortune Craps Recumbent bicycle Roller coaster Diabolo Glossary of nautical terms Laws of cricket Wicket Screw Heinkel He 100 Neckbreaker Happy Tree Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Slot machine Avenue Q Figure skating Snooker Gesture M60 machine gun Puppet St. Louis Cardinals Clarinet Steyr Mannlicher M1894 Hydraulic machinery Sling (weapon) Rod Stewart RuneScape Random Events 8-track cartridge Front crawl Dodge Neon System/34 Reel Lindy Basic Sailing Electric motor Softball Bullet Audio tape length and thickness Blooper American football Cessna T-37 Wind turbine Drag racing RuneScape quests System/36 Spirit rover timeline for 2004 March Backstroke Breaststroke The Midnight Sun
