i'm in need of major help with my algebra homework plz i did the problems but i'm not sure if they're right x x x x x combinding like terms s s w z w z if i could just get those anwers i can finish the rest thaaankkkkkss so much first let's rewrite the equation x x x x x now let's simplify the equation remember the two minus signs makes a plus so you final answer is s s the s and s are alike so s is your answer w z w z the w and w are alike the z and z are alike so w z is your answer hope this helps Elementary algebra Gravity Mathematics Kernel (algebra) Exponential function William Rowan Hamilton Division by zero Navier-Stokes equations Algebraic geometry Quartic equation Descartes' theorem Potential flow Maxwell's equations Representations of Clifford algebras Laplace operator Nondimensionalization Galois theory TI-89 series Detroit Tigers Lagrangian mechanics Einstein's field equation Quintic equation Dynamical system Series (mathematics) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Newton's identities Ordinary differential equation Polynomial Abstract algebra Simplified Chinese character Group theory Arthur Cayley Transmission line Levi-Civita symbol Boolean algebra Fermat's last theorem Theory of conduct Laws of Form Complex number Clifford algebra Two's complement Gauge theory Quaternion Polynomial interpolation GED Cubic equation ___1 (number) Dirac equation Linear algebra 2000 Australian Grand Prix Calculus Lotka-Volterra equation Riemann zeta function Particle in a box Computer algebra system Linear equation Mnemonic Angular velocity Oliver Heaviside Diophantine equation Bohm interpretation Riemann integral Classical mechanics Joseph Louis Lagrange Weierstrass's elliptic functions Generalized function Renormalization Covariance and contravariance Naive set theory Irrational number Elementary arithmetic Partial differential equation Computer numbering formats Determinant Plus and minus signs Anti-Zionism Stochastic process Algebraic topology Gaussian elimination Root-finding algorithm Algebra Astrobiology Newton's method Aberration in optical systems Confluence Quiz Call Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Quadratic equation Perturbation theory Z-transform Stomach cancer Grade (education) Random walk Education in Romania Augustus De Morgan Explosive material Action (physics)
