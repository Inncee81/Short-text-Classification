parabola with a vertex and point find an equation for the parabola whose vertex is and passes through express your answer in the standard form for a quadratic if the parabola is vertical then the equation is of the form k y x putting x y k k substituting this in and multiplying by y x y x x y x x Parabola Cissoid of Diocles Conic section Quadratic equation Projective transformation Trajectory Archimedes Huzita's axioms Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Polynomial Elementary algebra Square root Triangle Line at infinity Quartic equation Linear equation Apollonius of Perga Circuit design Cubic equation Complex number Determinant Linear differential equation Resistor M__bius transformation Sturm-Liouville theory Simplex algorithm Renormalization Algebraic geometry Pascal's triangle Planetary orbit Similarity (mathematics) Partial fraction Dirac equation Chinese calendar Joseph Louis Lagrange Quadratic form Optimization (mathematics) Length of an arc Clifford algebra Ellipse Production function Diffraction Logistic map IP (complexity) Vedic mathematics Orbit equation XSL attack Catenary Simplex Modular form Angle Quintic equation Shader Timeline of mathematics Geographic coordinate system Polynomial interpolation Basis (linear algebra) Golden ratio Glossary of graph theory Gaussian elimination Force Trigonometric function Lorentz group Group theory Catalan number Dihedral group Polyhedron Line (mathematics) Manifold Galois theory Slope Astrodynamics Escape velocity Equation of time Polygon Color charge Linear regression Convex hull TI-89 series Linear programming Tensor Root-finding algorithm Quaternion P-adic number Theta function Dimensional analysis Pappus of Alexandria RLC circuit Recurrence relation Dual polyhedron Hexagonal lattice 5 (number) Gravity Desargues' theorem Trigonometric identity Quadratic sieve Exponentiation Curvature Quantum harmonic oscillator
