math problem could someone please help me with this math problem steps would we appreciated thanks joseph has liters of a mixture containing of boric acid how many water must be added to make the mixture boric acid thanks so long as there aren't any molarity issues for this problem sorry its been quite a while since my chemistry classses joseph will need to add liters of water at the starting point j has liters of boric acid and liters of water a mixture the amount of acid will not change in this problem with this in mind divide the amount of boric acid in the problem by the desired acid solution the result is a total amount of fluid needed which is liters since j already has liters of solution he needs to add liters to achieve the required total of liters Boric acid Concentration Hydrochloric acid E85 Sulfuric acid Explosive material Carbon dioxide Titration Protein sequencing Pressurized water reactor Electrophysiology Borax Chlorine Vinegar Ammonia Nuclear fuel cycle Boron Folic acid Polymerase chain reaction Battery (electricity) Alcohol fuel Acid dissociation constant Haloalkane Tofu Nitroglycerin Water (molecule) Hypoglycemia Tooth Hydronium PH Glycerin Nitric acid Helium Coulometry Insulin Base (chemistry) Miller-Urey experiment Enzyme Hydrogen sulfide Carbonic acid Origin of life Water purification Dialysis Francis Crick CPU design Hydrogen Motor oil SAT Heat Wine making Mole (unit) Biochemistry Technetium Acetic acid Caffeine Creating chemical solutions Ethanol Axial compressor Chemical oxygen demand Solvent Protein Citric acid Smoke-screen Sulfur Alum Soluble Joseph Louis Lagrange Belief revision Fire dancing Polymer Sake Salt Ethylene glycol Alkane Partial pressure Zeno's paradoxes Japanese tea ceremony Solution Raney nickel Embalming Diesel engine Lactic acid Decompression sickness PostScript Chemistry Buffer solution Rum Sodium hypochlorite Ocean thermal energy conversion Methanol Champagne (beverage) Mathematics Water Hydrogen chloride Vitamin C Fire extinguisher Silly Putty Analytical chemistry Fuel injection
