irrational and rational numbers are these numbers repeating and irrational or rational numbers and if they are rational numbers are they whole integers or natural numbers also would be irrational since its goes on and on natural numbers are the following etc they do not include zero they are the ones learned natural ly when learning to count whole numbers are the exact same thing as natural numbers but they include the number remember the o in whole looks like a zero integers are the following they are the opposites of the whole numbers zero is its own opposite note that they include whole numbers and natural numbers next rational numbers rational numbers are numbers that can be written as fractions these include the integers and therefore the natural and whole numbers since any number can be written over for instance is also the rational numbers introduce all the numbers that come between the integers and natural and whole numbers there is an exception to the above definition for rational numbers if the fraction when divided results in a number that goes on forever non terminating and does not repeat it is considered irrational for instance pi can be written as a fraction however when we divide by we get a non terminating non repeating decimal it is irrational when we use we get repeating so it is rational it is non terminating but it repeats use w for whole n for natural i for integer r for rational ir for irrational and let's do some quick examples it is i and r negative numbers throw out whole and natural possibilities n w i r satisfies all four definitions r because it repeats sqrt of ir does that help clarify Binary numeral system Irrational number Numeral system Decimal Continued fraction Real number P-adic number Computer numbering formats Ruffini's rule Vulgar fraction Exponentiation On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Pi Group (mathematics) Rational number Logarithm Square root Division (mathematics) Golden ratio Set Square root of 2 Number Trigonometric function Complex number Recurring decimal Proof that 0.999... equals 1 Supremum Integer Function (mathematics) Binomial coefficient Question mark function Arithmetic coding History of mathematics Musical notation Naive set theory Pell's equation Polymorphism (computer science) Recursion Python programming language Unix time Prime number George Peacock Riemann integral Natural number Negative and non-negative numbers Floating point Field (mathematics) Identical particles Euclidean algorithm Riemann zeta function Infinity JavaScript Meaning of life C plus plus Fractional calculus Floor function Cellular automaton Polynomial Addition Richard Dedekind Collatz conjecture Tamil language Egyptian numerals Factorial Computus Division by zero 2 (number) Word (computer science) Mathematics Absolute value Forth programming language Julian day Positional notation 0 (number) Imaginary unit Lambda calculus Transcendental number Epistemology Dihedral group BASIC programming language Hausdorff dimension Probability Combinatorics Order theory C syntax Greatest common divisor Cauchy sequence Lebesgue integration Quaternion Datatype Computable number X86 assembly language Prisoner's dilemma
