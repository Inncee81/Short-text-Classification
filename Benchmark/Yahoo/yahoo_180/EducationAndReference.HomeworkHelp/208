write an equation for the line containing the two given points m to do this use the equation y mx b y is y m is the slope and b is the y intercept so right now you have the slope m equaling so you can put that in the equation y x b in order to find b put the point given into the equation and solve y x b b b so b therefore the final equation is y x Linear equation Slope Projective transformation Conic section Trigonometric function Ordinary differential equation Cissoid of Diocles Derivative Curve fitting Trajectory M__bius transformation Quadratic equation Dirac equation Maxwell's equations Parabola Polynomial Algebraic geometry Huzita's axioms Chemical equation Cournot competition Siphon Line at infinity Gaussian elimination Duality (projective geometry) Square root Equation solving Force Quartic equation Yield curve Perturbation theory Tangent Welfare economics Sturm-Liouville theory Particle in a box Numerical analysis Calculus Einstein's field equation Runge-Kutta methods Schr__dinger equation Elementary algebra Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Linear differential equation Circle State space (controls) Aberration in optical systems Gr__bner basis Path integral formulation Joseph Louis Lagrange Lotka-Volterra equation Recurrence relation Complex number Planetary orbit Dynamical system Numerical ordinary differential equations Nonlinearity Quantum tunneling Bose gas Black-Scholes Transmission line Exponential function Line (mathematics) Mean value theorem Linear combination Bessel function Equinox Minkowski diagram Newton's method Linear Roman surface Magnetic field Special relativity Equation of motion Marian Rejewski Apollonius of Perga Discrete Fourier transform Derivation of the partition function WKB approximation Action (physics) RLC circuit Root-finding algorithm Incidence (geometry) Rhumb line Pendulum Cubic equation Trigonometric identity Mathematics of general relativity Finite element method Partial differential equation Exponentiation Adjoint functors Electrical network Sim__on Denis Poisson Ellipse Geographic coordinate system Pascal's triangle Harmonic oscillator Temperature Production function
