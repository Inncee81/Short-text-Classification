how do you solve quadratic inequalities graphically the summer work for my hnrs precal course is algebra review and it's telling me to solve quadratic inequalities graphically and i have no idea how first just graph the quadratic as if it is an equality you should get a parabola a nice curve then you can test points both above or below inside or outside the parabola to see where to shade remember to use a dashed line for the parabola if it is a strict inequality and a solid line if it can also be equal to Parabola Conic section Quadratic equation Archimedes Cissoid of Diocles Ordinary differential equation Polynomial Square root Optimization (mathematics) Ellipse Linear equation Spline interpolation Elementary algebra Projective transformation Welfare economics Derivative Quadratic sieve Spline (mathematics) Curve Timeline of mathematics Computer graphics Manifold Bell test experiments Joseph Louis Lagrange Microeconomics Algebraic geometry B__zier curve Quadratic form Integer factorization Production function Huzita's axioms Cubic equation Enriques-Kodaira classification Quantum harmonic oscillator Planetary orbit Standard deviation Mathematics Uses of trigonometry Matroid Ruler-and-compass construction Complex number Apollonius of Perga Rendering (computer graphics) Quartic equation Julia set Geometry P-adic number Supersymmetry Length of an arc Line at infinity Economic inequality Inequality 3D computer graphics Trigonometric function Bell's theorem Algebra Legendre transformation Orthogonal group Curvature Elliptic curve Nonuniform rational B-spline TeX Random walk Existential graph Gaussian period Newton's method Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Tensor Intelligence quotient Hyperbola Local hidden variable theory Multiple integral Trajectory Lorentz group Hermann Minkowski Geographic information system Income inequality metrics Projective geometry XSL attack Computer representation of surfaces Externality Morse theory Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace TI-89 series Topology glossary Arthur Cayley Linear regression Affirmative action Catenary Extreme Programming Riemannian geometry Polynomial interpolation Exact solutions in general relativity Pappus of Alexandria EPR paradox M__bius transformation Ruffini's rule Partial fraction John Wallis
