how do you use factoring to solve r r once again i need the steps so i can apply it to other problems r r r r r r r r r r now you need to factor this lots of ways to factor a trinomial that does not have a leading coefficient of i use the bottoms up method here is a link to a description of it but you might factor this some other way http mathforum org t t message taco thread message r r step multiply leading coefficient by constant step find two numbers that multiply to and sum to and step write the two previous factors as two multiplying factors r r step now divide both numbers by whatever your leading coefficient was in our case it was r r r r after you factor it you should get r and r Polynomial Projective transformation Ruffini's rule Vedic mathematics Discrete Fourier transform Sturm-Liouville theory Linear differential equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Recurrence relation Binomial coefficient Formal power series Quadratic equation Quartic equation Polynomial long division Circuit design Discrete cosine transform Complex number RSA Pascal's triangle Partial fraction P-adic number Fibonacci number Quadratic sieve Shor's algorithm Mental calculation Fast Fourier transform Dirac equation Daubechies wavelet M__bius transformation Nondimensionalization Dimensional analysis Elementary arithmetic Lagrange multipliers Regression analysis Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Truss Trip distribution JPEG Resistor Cissoid of Diocles Quantum computer Algebra over a field Special number field sieve Orthogonal matrix Quantum harmonic oscillator Riemann zeta function Combinatorics Divisor Microeconomics Prime number Series (mathematics) Z-transform Fermi-Dirac statistics Basel problem Correlation Pi Tensor Heat equation Derivation of the partition function Newton's identities Affine transformation SAML Complexity classes P and NP Proofs of Fermat's little theorem Newton's method Catalan number Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm Galois theory Compiler optimization Lebesgue integration Conic section Trip generation Factor analysis Explosive material Debye model Cryptanalysis Error correction and detection Multiplication algorithm Transformation problem Logarithm Continued fraction Napier's bones Mathematics of general relativity Number theory Bose-Einstein statistics Torque Computer numbering formats Quantum tunneling 3D projection Taylor series Polynomial ring Trigonometric function Square root Multiplier (Fourier analysis) Irrational number Polarization
