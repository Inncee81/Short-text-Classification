if x varies directly as y and x when y then what is the value of x when y i got but the correct answer according the the book is can someone explain how to solve this with step by step work in other words x don't give me some whacky answer like i've been getting on my other questions when i've already written clearly that x x varies directly as y therefore is to as x is to x x therefore since the in the denominator is multiplied by to get you have to multiply the in the numerator by also to find x x and that is how they got x hope this helps p s you could have also done x in which case when you cross multiply you'll get x x x Vedic mathematics Vulgar fraction Computer numbering formats Continued fraction Crossword Bayesian inference A Course In Miracles Ordinary differential equation Projective transformation Gaussian elimination Expert system Quartic equation Software testing Infantilism Egyptian mathematics Elementary arithmetic Jackpot (game show) Wheel of Fortune Pascal's triangle Shor's algorithm Esperanto grammar Theory of conduct New Testament Halting problem Derivative COBOL Lagrange multipliers Quantum computer Complexity classes P and NP Discrete cosine transform Jacob Neusner Trigonometric function Partial fraction Lebesgue integration Egyptian fraction Formal power series Biblical inerrancy Mental calculation Trigonometric identity Newton's method GED Scientology beliefs and practices On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Sturm-Liouville theory Algorithm Series (mathematics) Infant baptism Transformation problem Photography Complex number Circuit design Orthogonal matrix Meaning of life Random walk LU decomposition God RuneScape Random Events Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Phase-locked loop P-adic number Optimization (mathematics) Slide rule Christianity Derivation of the partition function Joseph Louis Lagrange 3D projection Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?
