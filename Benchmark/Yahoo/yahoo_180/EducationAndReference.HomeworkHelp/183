can someone help me quick sue and tom wright are assistant professors at the local university they each take home about per year after taxes sue is years of age and tom is their two children mike and karen are and were either one to die they estimate that the remaining family members would need about of the present combined take home pay to retain their current standard of living while the children are still dependent this does not include an extra month in child care expenses that would be required in a single parent household they estimate that survivors' benefits would total about per month in child support both tom and sue are knowledgeable investors in the past average after tax returns on their investment portfolio have exceeded the rate of inflation by about if sue wright was to die today how much would the wrights need in the family maintenance fund use the needs approach and explain the reasons behind your calculations suppose the wrights found that both tom and sue had a life insurance protection gap of present the steps in sequence how wrights should proceed to search for protection to close that gap show all work for each assignment and explain each step carefully is your teacher a sadist or something that's the worst word problem i've ever seen okay let's see first we need to determine how much of the income goes to support each child because the children will come of age at different times since it takes of their annual income to support the entire family minus sue it's probably safe to assume that it of their income went to sue's welfare one can reasonably assume that it would also take of their yearly income would also go to tom's welfare leaving for the children divide that by and each child also gets of their current income of their combined income of is so it takes a year to support each child it will cost an additional a month for childcare yearly that would cost x months presumably half of this goes towards childcare for each child so the current total for child care yearly is tom would receive a month in survivor's benefits this totals to a year in survivor's benefits x months which would total a year per child in survivor's benefits children since that money is already available tom and sue don't need to put that money into their maintenance fund so the total per year per child that they would need to put into the fund would be mike is and thus tom would need to support him for more years before he became of age years x as the total amount needed in the fund to support mike until he's legally an adult karen is and thus would need to be supported for years before she comes of age years x as the total amount needed in the fund to support karen until she's legally and adult is the amount sue and tom need to have in the family maintenance fund in order to support both kids until they're of age at least that's how i'd figure it you could also figure in the rate of inflation but the problem hasn't given you the rate of inflation only the amount their portfolio exceeds that rate so i chose to ignore it Annuity Social Security (United States) Insurance Life insurance Microeconomics FairTax Social Security debate (United States) Tax Unemployment Bond Divorce Gross domestic product Mutual fund Health insurance Education in the United States Economy of Russia Expert system United Kingdom corporation tax 401(k) Inflation Labour economics Education in the People's Republic of China Economic inequality Mortgage Student loan Personal finance Capital accumulation Ponzi scheme Bretton Woods system Arguments for and against drug prohibition Variable universal life insurance Capitalism Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Government debt Labor theory of value Child support National Insurance Trust (Law) USA Economics Pension Unemployment benefit Space Shuttle program Keynesian economics Salary cap Publicly funded medicine Software patent debate No Child Left Behind Act Politics of Canada Institutional fund management Modern portfolio theory Growth hormone treatment Corporate finance Children of God Economy of the United States Free trade PE ratio Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Freeters Income trust Money Nuclear power Measures of national income and output Blackjack Minimum wage Centrelink Flat tax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Alcohol fuel Cost of capital Progressive tax Medicare (Canada) Explosive material Credit card Public domain Infantilism Article One of the United States Constitution Grade (education) Contract Corporation Capital gains tax Health savings account United States dollar Daylight saving time Lloyd's of London George W.
