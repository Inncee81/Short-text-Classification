help me plz simplify this expression type the variable term before the constant term x x x x x expressions in algebra consist of constants and variables a constant is a quantity whose value remains the same throughout a particular problem a variable is a quantity whose value is free to vary there are two kinds of constants fixed and arbitrary numbers such as and p are examples of fixed constants their values never change in x the numbers and are fixed constants arbitrary constants can be assigned different values for different problems arbitrary constants are indicated by letters quite often letters at the beginning of the alphabet such as a b c and d in ax b the letters a and b represent arbitrary constants the form ax t b represent many linear equations if we give a and b particular values say a and b then these constants become fixed for this particular problem and the equation becomes x t a variable may have one value or it may have many values in a dlscuseion the letters at the end of the alphabet such as x y z and w usually are used to represent variables in x the letter x is the variable if x then and so on for as many values of x as we desire to select and so on for as many values of x as we desire to select if the expression x is set equal to some particular number say then the resulting equality x holds true for just one value of x the value is since in an algebraic expression terms that contain a variable are called variable terms terms that do not contain a variable are constant terms the expression x contains one variable term and one constant term the variable term is x while is the constant term in ax b ax is the variable term and b is the constant term a variable term often is designated by naming the variable it contains in x x is the x term in ax by ax is the x term while by is the y term Variable Complex number Lorentz group Normal distribution Polynomial Derivative M__bius transformation Maxwell's equations Boolean algebra Particle in a box Mathematics of general relativity Gaussian elimination Partition function (statistical mechanics) Explosive material Elementary algebra Vector (spatial) Quantification C syntax Transformation problem Function (mathematics) State space (controls) Gauge theory Resistor Quantum mechanics Compiler optimization Unicode Exponentiation Circumscription Orthogonal matrix RLC circuit Nondimensionalization Linear equation Combinatory logic String (computer science) Curry-Howard Exponential function Propositional calculus Laws of Form Navier-Stokes equations Cumulant Formal power series Projective transformation Linked list Common Lisp Probability On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences PID controller Renormalization Mathematics Production theory basics Calculus Microeconomics Stochastic process Planck units Arbitrary constant of integration CIE 1931 color space Entropy Force Einstein-Cartan theory Color Continued fraction Series (mathematics) Sheaf (mathematics) C programming language Abstraction (computer science) Dirac equation Derivation of the partition function Quantum harmonic oscillator Production function Exact solutions in general relativity ALGOL 68 Boolean logic Tuple relational calculus P-adic number Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Aberration in optical systems Mathematical logic Supply and demand Linear regression Programming language Fibonacci number Partial differential equation Field (mathematics) Model (abstract) Digital circuit Bose gas Harmonic oscillator Lambda calculus Simplex algorithm Model (economics)
