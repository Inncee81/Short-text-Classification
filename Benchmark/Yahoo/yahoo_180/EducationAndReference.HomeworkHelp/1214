please help me with my science project i'm desperate whoever decided to answer this question thank u so much well i need some answers here what are vitamin a vitamin c vitamin d vitamin e vitamin k vitamin b thiamine b riboflavin b niacin b and b also i need to know what is phosphorus sodium copper flurine and zinc plz tell what these vitamins and minerals do and where u get it thanks for ur help note i wrote some words on caps so u can pay attention to that part so plz do not be concerned thanks for the people out there who r willing to help vitamins a vitamin is any group of organic substances other than proteins carbohydrates fats minerals and organic salts which are essential for normal metabolism growth and development vitamins regulate metabolic processes control cellular functions and prevent diseases such as scurvy and rickets let's examine what each vitamin does for us what happens if there is a deficiency and from what foods we can get them vitamin a essential for normal growth integrity of the skin and bone development lack of vitamin a can lead to infection of the cornea conjunctiva the red part of the eye trachea windpipe hair follicles and renal system deficiency can also cause night blindness vitamin a is found in butter butterfat in milk egg yolk some fruits prunes pineapples oranges limes and cantaloupe green leafy vegetables and carrots vitamin b complexes vitamin b thiamine affects growth appetite and carbohydrate metabolism alcoholics can be especially deficient b is found in whole grains nuts egg yolk fruits and most vegetables vitamin b riboflavin affects growth and cellular metabolism the ability of the cell to take in food make energy and discard waste found in liver meat poultry eggs milk and green vegetables a deficiency in vitamin b niacin will cause pellagra which is associated with the four d's dermatitis diarrhea dementia and death found in liver meat poultry and green vegetables vitamin b biotin folic acid and cyanocobalamin is found in leafy green vegetables organ meats lean beef and veal and wheat cereals a deficiency will result in pernicious anemia and neurological problems including numbness and weakness vitamin c ascorbic acid necessary for the formation of connective tissue between cells as well as maintenance of the cement that secures cells to membranes a deficiency will lead to scurvy shallow complexion loss of energy pain in legs and joints bleeding gums and muscle pain vitamin c is found in raw cabbage carrots orange juice lettuce celery onions tomatoes and all citrus fruits vitamin d necessary for the development of bones and teeth a deficiency can lead to rickets and tooth decay it is essential in the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus two of the most important constituents of bone and teeth vitamin d is manufactured in the skin with exposure to sunlight and is also found in milk cod liver oil salmon egg yolk and butter fat vitamin e although the exact function of this vitamin is not clearly understood it is essential to humans and has been related to the healing of scars a deficiency is extremely rare as vitamin e is found in many foods vitamin k essential for blood clotting vitamin k is found in fats oats wheat rye and alfalfa minerals if you think minerals aren't important in the diet think again minerals are essential acting as co factors of enzymes enzymes would not exist or function without minerals and as organizers of the molecular structure of the cell and its membrane there are fourteen trace minerals necessary for survival a few of which are discussed below chromium necessary for the maintenance of normal blood sugar levels chromium works with insulin in assisting cells to take in glucose and release energy some good sources include meats unrefined foods fats and vegetable oils chromium picolinate has not been shown to cause weight loss and its effectiveness at improving insulin's ability to break down glucose is being questioned copper needed for the production of red blood cells and the formation of connective tissues also plays a major role in the defense against free radicals some sources include meat seafood nuts and seeds fluorine maintains the structure of teeth taken regularly flourine will help protect teeth from acidic decay sources include water in some areas seafood kidney liver and other meats manganese activator of many enzymes manganese is very closely related to the synthesis of dna rna and protein sources include whole grains and cereals fruits and vegetables selenium important in protecting lipids of cell membranes cell walls are made up of a lipid fat layer proteins and nucleic acids against oxidant damage sources include broccoli chicken cucumbers egg yolk garlic liver milk mushrooms onions seafood and tuna zinc zinc represents only percent of the human body but is essential for synthesis of protein dna and rna it is required for growth in all stages of life sources include meats oysters and other seafood milk and egg yolk
