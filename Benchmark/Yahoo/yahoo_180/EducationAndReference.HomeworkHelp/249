define the following word energy transfer energy transfer en r j trans f r meteorology the transfer of energy of a given form among different scales of motion for example kinetic energy may be transferred between the zonal and meridional components of the wind or between the mean and eddy components of the wind energy transfer may utc cody mankin may utc this article or section is in need of attention from an expert on the subject wikiproject science may be able to help recruit one if a more appropriate wikiproject or portal exists please adjust this template accordingly in physics energy transfer describes the process of transferring energy from one system to another in chemistry the term may be used to describe the process of transferring vibrational energy from one molecule or molecular domain to another molecule or molecular domain the flow of energy through life is not an endless cycle the energy doesn't go round and round getting used over and over again and never wearing out its passage through the food chain can better be described as in and out as energy moves up the food chain there is less and less of it to go around that's the main reason there aren't very many big fierce predators compared to the herbivores not enough energy for them we'll talk about this in detail in another section but a brief explanation goes something like the following most of the solar energy that falls on the earth is not used by plants it bounces back to space or heats the air oceans and ground and makes weather among other things sooo the plants only get a little bit of the solar energy that hits the earth and the herbivores only get a little bit of the energy that hits the plants and the carnivores and decomposers only get a little bit of the energy that was eaten by the herbivores most of the plant energy that is consumed by a herbivore is used by that herbivore to keep itself eating breathing walking and staying warm only a little bit is left over for the carnivore or decomposer that eats the herbivore sooo at the end of the chain there isn't much of that original solar energy left therefore we need fresh sunshine everday and new plants have to keep growing otherwise the w Energy Water (molecule) Temperature Cell (biology) Water Energy development Renewable energy Entropy Origin of life Solar system Planetary orbit Solar variation Sun Trophic level Mass Wind Future energy development Solar cell Physics Biology Thermodynamics Meteorology Global climate model Solar power Physical science Carbon Coriolis effect Huygens probe Aurora (astronomy) Explosive material Geomagnetic storm Molecule Wind power Global warming Earth Greenhouse effect Environmental concerns with electricity generation Spectroscopy Photosynthesis Enzyme Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Dinosaur Heat Nuclear power Helium Moon Protein Emergence Spacecraft propulsion Science Mitochondrion Carnivore Navier-Stokes equations Sunlight Ocean thermal energy conversion Phase (matter) Francis Crick Ionosphere Hydrogen Nuclear reactor Soil Power station Life Conservation of energy Nuclear magnetic resonance Ozone depletion Origin belief Air conditioning Polarization Nitrogen Hydrogen vehicle Alternative biochemistry Corrosion Earth's atmosphere Opportunity rover Mass spectrometry Europe Circuit design Brown Bear Gravity Solar wind Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Central processing unit Food chain General relativity Severe weather terminology (United States) Flux
