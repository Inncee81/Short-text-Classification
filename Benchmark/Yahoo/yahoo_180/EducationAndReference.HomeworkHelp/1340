can someone help me with hmwrk please x x i need help with the steps and thank you the rules for this problem if there are no parentheses is you work it in order so you do times x plus is greater than x equals i think the greater than is somehow wrong in this equation because x is already going to be larger than x already are you sure that you typed it correctly just remember these steps for math if there are parentheses and do those first multiplying first addition second and then outside of parentheses hope this helps Bracket Multiplication Negative and non-negative numbers On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Exponentiation Conway chained arrow notation Ordinary differential equation Risk management Orders of magnitude (numbers) Order of operations Elementary algebra Cissoid of Diocles Invalid proof Operator (programming) Aberration in optical systems Physics SAT Dither Catalan number Boolean logic Slide rule Debugging Numerical integration Associativity Linear differential equation Planetary orbit Ruffini's rule Orthogonal matrix Vulgar fraction Complexity classes P and NP Complex number Richter magnitude scale Homogeneous coordinates Radar Diving Inequality Dirac equation Gaussian elimination Einstein-Cartan theory Calculator Polynomial Pi The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything Vedic mathematics Circle Projective transformation 3D projection Single Transferable Vote Point groups in three dimensions Transcontinental nation Central processing unit Surreal number Matrix (mathematics) Quicksort Mass spectrometry Spline (mathematics) Mnemonic Labour economics Resistor Large numbers Fischer Random Chess C syntax Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm Square root Modular exponentiation ___1 (number) Lagrange multipliers Unix time Specific impulse Luminiferous aether Cascading Style Sheets Color Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti Polymorphism (computer science) Relational algebra Perl Discrete cosine transform Riemann zeta function Elementary arithmetic Numerical ordinary differential equations Lambda calculus Fast Fourier transform Intel i860 Linear algebra Nondimensionalization Group (mathematics) Quartic equation Continued fraction Trigonometric identity Mathematics Fluctuation theorem Jet engine Sobolev space Torque Sheffer stroke Betting (poker) Mental calculation Key punch
