math hw help find the degree measure of each angle of a quadrilateral if the measures of its angles are represented by x x x x can you show me please the sum of the angles of a quadrilateral equals degrees so add all those up and you get x then x now substitute for each x and you'll have the degree measure for each angle Angle Polygon Quadrilateral Trigonometric identity Convex hull Trigonometric function Triangle Conic section Parallel postulate Circle Pi Vector (spatial) 4 (number) Explosive material Ruler-and-compass construction Complex number Symmetry Spline (mathematics) Cissoid of Diocles Spherical trigonometry Polarization Welfare economics Ptolemaios's theorem Navigation Celestial navigation Stairway Degree (angle) Tessellation Trajectory Einstein-Cartan theory Minute of arc Trigonometry Numeral system Pythagorean theorem Quaternions and spatial rotation Lebesgue integration Tsirelson's bound Aberration in optical systems Computer representation of surfaces Addition Microphone Normal distribution Parallax Data clustering Geometry Measure (mathematics) Exponentiation Circuit design Magnetic declination Quaternion Orthogonal matrix Torque Astrodynamics Wallpaper group Statistical mechanics 120 (number) Series and parallel circuits Force VHF omnidirectional range Geographic coordinate system Diffraction Bloodstain pattern analysis Euclidean geometry Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Occipital bone Faster-than-light Lattice (group) Determinant Curve fitting Root system Projective transformation Euclidean plane isometry Eratosthenes Mandible Map projection Dice Geodesy Orthographic projection Horizontal coordinate system Pyroxene Radar Taylor series Ordinary differential equation Diamond Prosthaphaeresis Linear regression Luminiferous aether Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) Longitude Point groups in three dimensions Hipparchus (astronomer) Rotational symmetry Binary numeral system World line Microeconomics Capital controversy Binomial coefficient Hilbert's third problem Coherent state
