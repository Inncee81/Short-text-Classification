how to solve x x step by step would be greatly appreciated as i have more problems like the one above thanks for your time x x this is a quadratic equation in x put u x u u u u u or u hence from x sqrt u or Quartic equation Square root Quadratic equation Grover's algorithm Ruler-and-compass construction RLC circuit Heat equation Cubic equation Conic section Quadratic sieve Quantum harmonic oscillator Ordinary differential equation TeX Random walk TI-89 series Green's function Newton's method Nondimensionalization Linear differential equation Black-Scholes Recurrence relation Mathematics Standard deviation Dirac equation Trajectory Verlet integration Elementary algebra Root-finding algorithm Quantum tunneling Arthur Cayley Cholesky decomposition Julia set Laplace transform Bessel function Escape velocity Ruffini's rule Galois theory Optimal control Cissoid of Diocles RC circuit Augustus De Morgan Perturbation theory Quantum computer Two-body problem Particle in a box XSL attack Combinatorics Hartree-Fock Vedic mathematics Harmonic oscillator Huzita's axioms Optimization (mathematics) Trigonometric identity Imaginary unit Polynomial Daubechies wavelet Quintic equation Pendulum Measurement in quantum mechanics Pentagon Root mean square Archimedes Kalman filter COBOL Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Maxwell's equations Generating function Planetary orbit Pi Parabola Astrodynamics Negative and non-negative numbers Golden ratio Brachistochrone curve Numerical ordinary differential equations Proper time Gas in a box Phi to the fourth Secant method Geodesic (general relativity) Earth radius Planck units Debye sheath Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Linear regression Chemical equation Analytic geometry Computational complexity theory Partial differential equation Finite element method Continuous Fourier transform Group theory Basis (linear algebra) Monochromatic electromagnetic plane wave Modified Newtonian dynamics Production function Alternating current
