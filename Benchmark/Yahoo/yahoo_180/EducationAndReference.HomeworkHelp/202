when an electrons company produces chips it makes a profit of dollars per unit when it produces chips the company makes a profit of dollars per unit assume that a linear relationship fits these data use the linear equation to predict the profit per unit if the company produced chips let y number of chips produced let x profit in dollars per unit y x at chips produced the profit is per unit CPU design Supply and demand Transformation problem IBM Correlation Electrical network Linear regression Integrated circuit Profit maximization Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient Commodore International Mathematical model Moore's law Prices of production Cournot competition Intel Inertial guidance system Electronic commerce Stackelberg competition RISC Atari 2600 Maxwell's equations Mass spectrometry Doomsday argument Torque Arbitrage Operational amplifier Microeconomics Phase-locked loop Microprocessor United States dollar Digital Equipment Corporation Capital accumulation Flip-flop (electronics) United Artists Nonlinearity Super Nintendo Entertainment System Electron Clipper chip Kalman filter Potato chips Progressive tax PowerPC Profit Recurrence relation Mostek MOS Technology SID Welfare economics Electronic Arts Labor theory of value Acorn Computers Procter & Gamble Analog-to-digital converter Partial differential equation Data (Star Trek) Gravitational radiation Sociocultural evolution Linear algebra Digital circuit Roulette Light Electromagnetic radiation Algorithm Surplus value Ford Motor Company Business Data Encryption Standard Linear equation Nintendo 64 Intellivision Equation of state American individualist anarchism Commodore PET MSX Capital controversy Sinclair Research Ltd Matrix (mathematics) Factor analysis Arbitrage pricing theory Poker jargon Central processing unit Enron Corporation Dynamical system Transmission line Orbital hybridisation Molecular orbital 64-bit Einstein's field equation Microprogram Hartree-Fock Linear least squares Regression analysis PC Engine Least squares Octopus card Interpolation Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Autoregressive moving average model
