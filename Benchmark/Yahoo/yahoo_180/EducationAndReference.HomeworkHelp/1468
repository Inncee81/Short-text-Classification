need help due day after tomorrow write essay about julius caesar i'm writing an essay about julius caesar not the play but caesar himself and i need to write a specific topic about what i wanted to find out about caesar then pose three key questions regarding the topic well i thought of a topic like the difference between julius caesar as a mortal man and as a public figure but i don't know if that topic makes sense or what can u explain to me my topic i really need helpp please i need it done by tomorrow anyway my key questions are how does julius caesar continue to have power over events even after he is dead do the conspirators succeed in their goals by killing him is caesar s influence too powerful to be contained even by his death i really like those key questions but i dunno how it relates to the topic mentiond before awww maannn can u help me pleasee umm i know i need to do this by myself coz that would be cheating if you just told me the answer right but i don't want an answer to my questions i only want to know if my key questions relate to my topic and if my topic is good i really need help i love your topics and seem to be closely related is a yes or no question anyway so i suggest that you get rid of it you can relate and if the conspirators do not succeed in their goals you could argue that that is true because caesar's power and influence continues through the laws that he had passed though the changes he had made to roman society through his writings and through the ways he had affected people you'd certainly want to mention octavius if you choose to answer only discuss what the various conspirators' goals and motivations were they were not by any means motivated by the same goals some were motivated by envy some possibly by jealousy some many by cupidity some by the desire for power some were possibly merely malicious what did each conspirator hope to gain by caesar's death hmm i wish i were writing it myself David Hume Phaedo Theodicy Caesar Augustus Tiberius Free will Paul of Tarsus Roman Republic Theory of conduct Atomism Plame affair Philosophy Mark Antony Conspiracy Cicero Book of Revelation Philosophy of language Cato the Younger Philosophy of mathematics Tacitus Asterix and the Laurel Wreath Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Roman Emperor Roman Empire Objectivist philosophy Virgin Birth (Christian doctrine) Assassination Social psychology Cryptography Social rule Marcus Junius Brutus Marius Sexual orientation Nero Goldstein's book Logic Conspiracy theory Coercion Leo Strauss Goodness and value theory Roman Kingdom GED Faith (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) Library of Alexandria Summa Theologiae Justification (theology) Joseph Addison Battle of Alesia Saruman Second language acquisition Federalist No. 10 Originalism Aristotle Universal pragmatics Iago Annuity Philosophy of science Christopher Marlowe Cleopatra VII of Egypt Roman conquest of Britain Antony and Cleopatra Predestination Psychology Sub-Zero Biblical inerrancy Irony Appeal Love English grammar Nicomachean Ethics Peter Singer Novel Caesar (title) Evil Apotheosis Kain (Legacy of Kain) Software engineering Confucianism Claudius New Testament view on Jesus' life Prayer Causality Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Deconstruction The Dalek Invasion of Earth
