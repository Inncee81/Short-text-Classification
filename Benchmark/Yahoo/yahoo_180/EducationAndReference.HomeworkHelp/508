what if i have more than four quotes in a sentence and all of them are from the same page of a book i need this in strict mla format and i already know i have to cite and how to i'm just confused as to whether or not cite each and every quote because when i do it looks strange you simply use your s within and cite the source and page at the end of the sentence as such however you want to be careful about using so many quotes you want to pick your quotes carefully and integrate them into sentences of your own not the other way around you want to weave those quotes into your writing so seamlessly that they are part of your dialogue pick the quote that you absolutely cannot do without that which you would do no justice to if you put it into your own words four sounds like too much Citation Finnish language Quotation mark Case citation American and British English differences Socrates Tacitus Talmud Discordianism Morphology (linguistics) Mixtape Book of Isaiah Aramaic language Theory of conduct Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Authorship of the Johannine works Thomas Pynchon Biblical inerrancy Apocrypha Quotation G__del's incompleteness theorem Bash.org Meaning New Testament Goodness and value theory De re publica Gettysburg Address XHTML Kanji Freedom of speech Ethics Chinese language HTML element Crossword Pleonasm Amiga Power Book of Mormon Milton H.
