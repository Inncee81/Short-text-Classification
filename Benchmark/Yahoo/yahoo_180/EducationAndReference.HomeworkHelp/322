a b c d a b c d what are the values of a b c and d a b c d a b c d multiply through by a b c d subtract from this eliminates 'a' b c d notice that and are each divisible by if one side of an equation is divisible by then the other side must also be divisible by the only way this can happen is if b is divisible by isn't so b must be divisible by and in fact b must be exactly rather than a multiple because the sum of a b c and d is as given so if b then becomes c d now divide through by c d subtract from both sides c d there is only one solution for this equation and that is that c and d substituting what we have so far into gives a therefore a let's see if it checks out in it does so a b c and d Binary numeral system Elementary algebra Trigonometric function Vedic mathematics Two's complement Gaussian elimination Trigonometric identity Golden ratio base Negative and non-negative numbers Vector (spatial) Quartic equation Recurrence relation Ordinary differential equation Quadratic equation Exponentiation Separation of variables Dimensional analysis Napier's bones Ternary Numeral system Sturm-Liouville theory Fibonacci number Roman arithmetic Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Cissoid of Diocles Computer numbering formats Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Divisor Square root Matrix (mathematics) Linear differential equation Basel problem Continued fraction Invalid proof Polynomial Riemann zeta function Quaternion Slide rule Transformation problem Inequality Brainfuck Fundamental theorem of calculus Combinatorial species Dirac equation Cube root Intel BCD opcodes Projective transformation IP (complexity) Heat equation Division (mathematics) Recurring decimal Gravity Adjoint functors Two-body problem Numerical analysis Elementary arithmetic Microeconomics Calculating the day of the week Quintic equation Conic section Group (mathematics) Equation solving Finite field arithmetic Quadratic sieve Clifford algebra Doomsday rule Vulgar fraction Principle of maximum entropy Particle in a box Newton's identities Even and odd numbers X86 assembly language P-adic number Calculator Money supply Identical particles Z-transform Real number Determinant Normal distribution Resistor Synthesizer Figurate number Trajectory Circuit design Irrational number Associativity Function (mathematics) Prime number Derivation of the partition function Apollo Guidance Computer Proof that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes diverges Extended Euclidean algorithm COBOL Electrical network Decibel Expected value Pointer
