explain it please i am really confused alpha beta gamma cookies can anyone explain to me the effects of alpha beta particles and gamma ray radiation to our body regarding their penertrating power and ionizing capacity said a alpha very little pentrating power and are able to ionize a large number of atoms within the small area they were able to penetrate b beta they can penetrate paper or several millimeters of skin and about metre of air they are absorbed by aluminum or perspex a few millimeters thick their ionizing capacity is less than that of alpha radiation c gamma it has no electric charge and has great enetrating power not even a thicj k piece of lead or concrete will stop all of them although their ionizing capacity is smaller that that of beta rays assume they were radioactive cookies containg each of them if you were allowed to eat one hold one and place one in your pocket which cookie should be placed where so that you wil receive the least radiation a b or c explain the less direct contact you would have the better of you are eating would be worst of all obviously the most contact and radiation would be all over your body picking between the other two can be a problem holding it would be bad for your hand but putting it in your pocket would bring radiation dangerously close to your reproductive organs that are very susceptible to radiation damage technically in your pocket would be least dangerous but if i had to make a choice i would go for the hand as holding it would protect the rest of my body at least from alpha a beta and because just a layer of clothing would hardly do any good and my whole body would be exposed to radiation Gamma ray Alpha particle Nuclear fallout Neutron Nuclear technology Nuclear physics Nuclear explosion Criticality accident Neutron radiation Radiation hardening Ionising Radiation Protection Plasma (physics) Uranium Radiography Nuclear weapon design Gravitational radiation Mobile phone radiation and health Radiation poisoning X-ray Diode Ionosphere Radiation therapy Ultraviolet Electromagnetic spectrum Technetium Terminal ballistics Geiger-M__ller tube Neutrino Radiosurgery Helium Cathode ray tube Nuclear power Carbon Nuclear fusion Kryptonite Ozone layer Laser Nuclear reaction Titanium Food irradiation Electromagnetic radiation Gas metal arc welding Light Dirac equation ATLAS experiment Cosmic microwave background radiation Depleted uranium Solar cell Fallout shelter Sun Cherenkov radiation Timeline of quantum mechanics, molecular physics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and particle physics Fire fighting Solar variation Gamma ray burst Welding Project Orion Tocopherol Planetary habitability Ionization chamber Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Gold foil experiment Vacuum Radiometric dating Thermoluminescence dating Tobacco smoking Optical fiber Beryllium Cosmic ray Electroshock gun Promethium Faster-than-light Stomach cancer Smoke detector Black hole Vacuum tube Campfire Nuclear weapon Electron Corrosion Psoriasis Cold fusion Gas tungsten arc welding Photoelectric effect Radium Geomagnetic storm General relativity
