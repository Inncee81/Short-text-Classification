what is the relationship between the slope of velocity vs time graph ave acceleration please expand broad your answer extended thanks p if velocity is plotted vertically and time horizontally then the slope at any point on the graph gives the acceleration at that moment in time the slope of the graph represents the rate at which the velocity is changing and that is the definition of acceleration in terms of calculus the acceleration is the derivative or differential coefficient of the velocity with respect to time Derivative Slope Calculus Special relativity Trigonometric function Classical mechanics Function (mathematics) Escape velocity Trajectory Supply and demand Tensor General relativity Polynomial World line Maxwell's equations Minkowski diagram Acceleration Angular velocity Astrodynamics Jet engine Velocity M__bius transformation Planetary orbit Vector (spatial) Microeconomics Self-adjoint operator Navier-Stokes equations Gradient Pendulum Integral Internal ballistics Conic section Moment of inertia Complex number Brachistochrone curve Exponential function Torque Kinematics Spacecraft propulsion Tangent Mathematics Ordinary differential equation Exogenous growth model Kalman filter Coriolis effect Spline (mathematics) Production theory basics Racetrack (game) Electromagnetic field Formal power series Polarization Gee Centripetal force Phillips curve Frame of reference Specific impulse Differential geometry and topology Magnetic field Newton's laws of motion IS/LM model Mass Zeno's paradoxes Lagrangian mechanics Mathematics of general relativity Kepler's laws of planetary motion Fictitious force Four-velocity Siphon Water turbine Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica Linear equation Inertia Projective transformation Curve Bessel function Stall (flight) Covariant derivative Graph theory Rigid body Potential energy Normal distribution Dynamical system Vector field Legendre transformation Yield curve Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Action potential Event horizon Tsiolkovsky rocket equation Seismometer TI-89 series Combinatorial species Action (physics) Lift (force) Random walk Faster-than-light Glossary of graph theory Natural logarithm
