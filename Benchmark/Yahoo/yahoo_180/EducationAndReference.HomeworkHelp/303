please help i need physical science investigatory project please give me example as soon as possible tnx can water be magnetized while studying about water i came across an article on the internet about magnetized water and it's healing properties the article suggests that magnetized water tastes sweeter and has more clarity magnetized water has therapeutic affects and can heal wounds and reduce fevers the purpose of this project is to find out if water can really be magnetized i will design and perform experiments to see how water can be magnetized and how it affects the physical properties of water Hypnosis Phase (matter) Nuclear magnetic resonance Magnetism Tattoo Prayer Solar variation Chemistry Medicine Superconductivity Magnetic monopole Clinical depression Computer Dirac equation Loudspeaker Mineral Plasma cosmology Transcranial magnetic stimulation Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Functional magnetic resonance imaging Chiropractic Cannabis (drug) Magnetic field Neutron Mathematics of general relativity Phase transition Thermodynamics Solar wind Magnetic levitation train Railgun Patent medicine Addiction Methylsulfonylmethane Final Fantasy magic Abortion Chlorpromazine Tide Lunar Prospector Special relativity Physical science Aurora (astronomy) Sun Meditation Stroke Electromagnetism Ecology Pok__mon Abilities Multiple sclerosis Spin (physics) Magnetic potential Magnet Homeopathy Western philosophy Materials science Health science Iron Plasma (physics) Physical therapy Swimming Transformer Particle physics ATLAS experiment Psychosis Neuropsychology Maxwell's equations Polarization Civil engineering Alternative medicine Philosophy of mind Beamline What the Bleep Do We Know!?
