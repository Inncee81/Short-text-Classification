translate to a system of equations and solve the sum of two numbers us their diffrence is find the 's pleaseeee let one of the numbers be x therefore the other number is x so we get x x x x x x x x Nonlinearity Recurrence relation Statistical mechanics Trigonometric function Schr__dinger equation Derivation of the partition function Ordinary differential equation Dynamical system Dirac equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Mathematics of general relativity Laplace transform Generating function Heat equation Archimedes Molecular dynamics Elementary algebra Complex number Fluid dynamics Vedic mathematics Matrix exponential Cholesky decomposition Square root Harmonic oscillator Quantum harmonic oscillator Momentum Daubechies wavelet Polynomial Galois theory Discrete Fourier transform Formal power series Numerical analysis Binomial coefficient Sturm-Liouville theory Hartree-Fock Bose gas Planetary orbit Lagrangian mechanics Particle in a box Partial differential equation Hamiltonian mechanics Einstein's field equation Cubic equation Matrix (mathematics) Newton's identities Prime number Linear differential equation Finite element method Action (physics) Exponentiation Bessel function Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics) Trigonometric identity Z-transform Identical particles Density functional theory Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Path integral formulation Leonhard Euler Liouville's theorem (Hamiltonian) Partial fraction Quantum tunneling Theta function Radius of convergence Quasispecies model Mathematics Force Measurement in quantum mechanics Marian Rejewski Quintic equation Modified Newtonian dynamics Two-body problem Logarithm Analog computer Maximum likelihood Weierstrass's elliptic functions History of mathematics Root-finding algorithm Quartic equation M__bius transformation Joseph Louis Lagrange Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution Quadratic equation Navier-Stokes equations Exponential function Diophantine equation Newton's method IP (complexity) Basel problem Lotka-Volterra equation Conic section Wave equation Pascal's triangle XSL attack Linear Holomorphic function Partition function (statistical mechanics)
