th grade math please help with this question ok this is getting me a little confused if you can show me how you worked it out that would be helpful thanks over the course of a month you keep track of how many times the next day's weather forecast is accurate the forecast is correct times in a month of days predict how many days over the course of a year the forecast will be correct and find the experimental probability that the forecast is correct ok so its right the track record out of if you watched it for days how many times would they be right twice as many days twice as many times right so how about days times as many days so times as many right how about year thats days is not a multiple of however isnt the ratio of right answers to days what we are looking for since there are days x where x is number of correct forecasts cross multiply to solve for x probability p times correct attempts use calculator to find p it should be between and gl Weather forecasting Mathematics Bayesian inference Pi Model (economics) Call centre National Weather Service Complexity classes P and NP Severe weather terminology (United States) Physics Artificial neural network Numerical weather prediction Meteorology Trip distribution Many-worlds interpretation Quantum computer 2005 Pacific hurricane season Probability 2005 Atlantic hurricane season 2004 Atlantic hurricane season GED Dither Monty Hall problem Standardized testing Delphi method Global climate model Bayes' theorem Gregorian calendar ELO rating system History of computing Prediction market Archimedes Lebesgue integration SAT Philosophy of mathematics Quantum mechanics PE ratio Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics) The Princeton Review Scientific method Debye model Tropical cyclone Normal distribution National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Randomized algorithm Standard deviation Jumpstart 3rd Grade Hebrew calendar Halting problem Vedic mathematics Full moon cycle Gravity Maya calendar Route assignment Radar Space Shuttle Columbia disaster Shor's algorithm MaxEnt thermodynamics Randomness Prior probability Weather John Titor Series (mathematics) Shipping Forecast Renal function Identical particles Age of the universe Quantum harmonic oscillator On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Viterbi algorithm Orders of magnitude (numbers) Matrix (mathematics) Celestial navigation Francis Crick Decision tree Grover's algorithm El Ni__o Statistics Multiplication algorithm Expert system Interpretation of quantum mechanics Rasch model Navigation Leap year Prediction Calculating the day of the week Computer simulation Probability theory Wave Race: Blue Storm Collision detection Continued fraction Customer relationship management Logarithm Solar variation Intelligent design Pok__mon Abilities Dirac equation Renormalization Hipparchus (astronomer)
