simple math question how do you solve these problems one printing machine works twice as fast as another when both machines are used they can print a magazine in hours how many hours would each machine require to do the job alone one pump can fill a water tank in hours and another pump takes hours when the ank was empty both pumps were turned on for minutes and then the faster pump was turned off how much longer did the slower pump have to run before the tank was filled can anyone help me on this cuz i'm horrible on these types of prob ty in advance suppose the slow machine can print k units in hour then the faster one can print k units in hour together the machines can print k units hour both machines together print magazine in hr magazine therefore contains k units of printing to get the printing time divide k by the printing rate of the machine or machines in use the slow machine will take k k hours alone and the faster one will take k k hours the fast pump fills of the tank in hour the slow pump fills of the tank in hour together they fill of the tank in hour in min they fill half this amount namely of the tank that means there is of the tank still to fill to fill of the tank the slow pump will take an additional time hr Tank classification CDC 6600 Thermal power station Carburetor RISC Dialysis CPU cache Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Central processing unit Internal ballistics Tank Speed of light Civil engineering and infrastructure repair in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina Carbon dioxide BASIC programming language 24 Hours of Le Mans Computer Siphon Weight training Hydrogen economy Rebreather Energy development Hydraulic machinery Messerschmitt Me 163 Three Mile Island Diesel engine Mach kernel Wind turbine Cardiac arrhythmia Quicksort Heinkel He 100 Dairy Paintball Brewery Linked list IBM PC compatible Decompression sickness Incandescent light bulb Solar power Sea-Monkey United States Postal Service Compiler optimization Space Shuttle program Vector processor Protoss Advance Wars: Dual Strike E85 Tidal power Terran (StarCraft) System/36 Entropy System/34 Labor theory of value Education in Romania Dry cleaning Typewriter Digital circuit Ammunition Armoured warfare Water purification Mitsubishi Zero Jet engine Transformer Movie projector Dog agility Messerschmitt Bf 109 Firearm Nuclear reactor Electrophysiology Reef tank Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Computer bus Indianapolis 500 Equation of time Chromatography Hypoglycemia Panama Canal Drag racing Irrigation Filling station Halting problem Paintball marker Calculus Cray-1 Fast bowling Digital photography MS-06 Zaku II Gameplay of StarCraft Vehicles in Unreal Tournament 2004 Computer chess Atari ST Space Shuttle external tank Gas metal arc welding Tempo Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2 NeXT
