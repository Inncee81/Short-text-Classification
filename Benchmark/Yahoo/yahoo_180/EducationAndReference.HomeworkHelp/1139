fast food nation by eric schlosser who is to blame since few people would confuse fast food with health food who bears the greater responsibility for the alarming rate of obesity in children in the united states the fast food chains that market supersize meals to children or parents who are not educating their children about the benefits of a balanced diet plz help me out with this question plz i swear ill return the favor the parents and the kids the parents aren't restricting their diets or enforcing proper eat and health styles there has been plenty of edia coverage available for people to see the hazards of fast food eric schlosser not only wrote that book but also produced 'super size me' most if not all fast food chains have stopped 'super sizing' their meals because of the bad rep they got from that documentary i once read a magazine article about a girl who was obese and convinved a doctor to do a surgical procedure on her even though she was because her dad was 'dying' so she could be slim and wear a black dress for him before he died whom recovered and didn't die when reading the article the parents were explaining how they did everything possible they gave her small healthy portions and made sure she didn't snitch food inbetween meals and while cooking dinner the mother even made a salad and sat with the girl during lunch later after the surgury the girl explained that she did go to the lunch only two or three times before her mother dropped off the salad for her to eat fast food chains have plenty of awareness out and available for the public now for mcdonalds on all their happy meal bags they have a table of the nutrional value and calories of the food available there are also more healthier options available for children including milk and apples instead of soda and fries it's up to american children and their parents to be responsible for their actions it's annoying when people go and sue fast food companies knocking other important cases out of the court room and wasting tax payers dollars because they ate mcdonalds or some other place's food so much that they became obese an employee isn't going to stop a customer from getting their food that's risking their job and a customer's fury upon themselves people need to learn to have a little more restraint hope this helps Super Size Me Dieting Hamburger Obesity Little Britain In-N-Out Burger Fast-food restaurant Meal Atkins Nutritional Approach Restaurant Cuisine of Denmark Publicly funded medicine Omega-3 fatty acid Breakfast Nutrition Foodborne illness Breastfeeding Milk Hypoglycemia Anorexia nervosa Fast Food Nation Hillary Rodham Clinton Wal-Mart Adjustable gastric band Low-carbohydrate diet Fecal incontinence Vegetarianism Divorce Soft drink Passover Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Ronald McDonald Happy Meal Veganism Burger King The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Terri Schiavo Fasting Urban sprawl Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Economy of the United States Microeconomics French fries Egg (food) Raw food diet Wall Street Garfield Kodocha French cuisine Dietary fiber EastEnders Folic acid Food and Drug Administration Tooth Eating Stomach cancer Fugu Cuisine of Laos Urinary incontinence Tea Japanese tea ceremony Trans fat Insurance Shaggy dog story Fish and chips Free trade Binge eating disorder Jewish cuisine Junk food Calvin and Hobbes Pitaten Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Escherichia coli O157:H7 Milton H.
