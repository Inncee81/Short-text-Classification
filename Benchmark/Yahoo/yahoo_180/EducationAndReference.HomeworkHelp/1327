how do i find the equation of the parabola with focus and directrix y i know the two forms of equations for a parabola are y a x h k and x a y k h i also know that the focus for the 'y ' form is h k a and the focus for the 'x ' form is h a k the directrix for the 'y ' form is y k a and the directrix for the 'x ' form is x h a you exactly can't just plug them in to figure it out which makes it tough how do i do it please explain if you answer thanks the focus is and the directrix is y which is a horizontal line the parabola is therefore symmetrical about a vertical axis as the focus is below the directrix the parabola opens downwards and will have an equation of the form x h a y k where h k is the vertex and a is the distance from the focus to the directrix for a parabola opening downwards a is negative the y co ordinate of the vertex is half way between that of the focus and that of the directrix and is therefore the x co ordinate of the vertex is the same as that of the focus namely the vertex is therefore substituting the vertex co ordinates in gives the equation x y Parabola Conic section Cissoid of Diocles Archimedes Projective transformation Hyperbola Trajectory Ellipse Triangle Wallpaper group Quadratic equation Semi-major axis Line at infinity Pappus of Alexandria Orbit equation Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Planetary orbit Tetrahedron Ordinary differential equation Complex number Symmetry combinations John Wallis Dirac equation Pascal's triangle Microeconomics Point groups in three dimensions Catenary Hexagonal lattice Escape velocity Slope Polynomial Doom engine Cartesian coordinate system Equation of time Geographic coordinate system Schwarzschild coordinates Cubic equation Polyhedron Trigonometric function Knife Huzita's axioms Kepler's laws of planetary motion Dijkstra's algorithm Resistor Suspension bridge Determinant Game theory Quaternion Coriolis effect Pendulum Manifold Astrodynamics Logistic map Telescope Collision detection Stress (physics) Square root Circuit design Map projection Longitude Desargues' theorem Lattice (group) 5 (number) Length of an arc Lens (optics) Glossary of graph theory Torque IP (complexity) Coordinates (mathematics) Regular polytope Fano plane Special relativity Modular group Feynman diagram Anthemius of Tralles M__bius transformation Similarity (mathematics) Simplex algorithm Angle Rotational symmetry Headlight Exponentiation Western concert flute Symmetry N-body problem Precession Flag of the People's Republic of China Linear equation Fixed-wing aircraft Isaac Barrow Amplitude Geodesy Perspective (graphical) Gravity Door Graph theory Dynamic programming
