algebra mixture problem can you please help me i dont understand how to do this its so confusing so yea please walk me through it step by step here is the problem a jar of m m's that has blue m m's is mixed with a jar of m m's that has blue m m's to obtain grams of a jar with blue m m's how many grams of the blue m m's should be added thank you using algebra let x the number of grams of the blue m ms added x is what you are looking for then x would have to be the number of grams for the blues the equation becomes x x take it from there x x x x add grams of the blues you can get this through logic but you are learning to use algebra Mathematics Explosive material Polynomial Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Linear algebra Boolean algebra Geometry Elementary algebra Gram staining Quaternion Staining (biology) Number theory Algebra Concentration Galois theory Real number Prime number SI prefix Associative algebra Algebraic geometry Agar plate Ruler-and-compass construction Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Avgas William Rowan Hamilton Axiom Cheese Logic Kleene algebra Algebraic topology Newton's identities Color blindness Combinatorial species George Boole Calculator Ternary Adjoint functors P-adic number Motive (algebraic geometry) Curve Newton's method Gottfried Leibniz Mole (unit) Digital circuit Color Two's complement Laws of Form Supersymmetry Joseph Louis Lagrange Quartic equation Transcendental number Boolean logic Covariance and contravariance Diophantine equation Exponentiation Algebra over a field Propositional calculus Orthogonal matrix Infinity Naive set theory Arthur Cayley Recursion Vulgar fraction Sheaf (mathematics) Quantum logic George Peacock Supertask Distributivity Nintendo DS Probability Illegal drug trade Elliptic curve Hamiltonian mechanics Gaussian elimination Standard deviation Irrational number Modal logic Fibonacci number Substitution cipher Fermat's last theorem Debugging Collision detection Lorentz group Group (mathematics) Pneumonia Tai shogi Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Timeline of mathematics Exterior algebra Function (mathematics) Octopus Artificial neural network Lie group E85 Action potential Gram-negative Metric system Field (mathematics) Polymerase chain reaction
