math problem i need help soon please a galvanized iron sheet cm wide is to be bent to form a gutter by turning up vertical strips along each side how many centimeters should be turned up at each side in order to give a gutter with the maximum cross sectional area could you please help me with this problem and please put your solution or an explanation on how did you get the answer please i really need to answer this thanks two dimensions v the vertical height of the turned up edge b the width of the remaining base v b v b a objective amax let's simplify the second equation by substituting b from the st b v so v v a or v v a v we want to know the maximum a v which can be found where the derivative of a v with respect to v is d a v v where v v test this using equation v b or b b so amax would be v b or cm whereas dividing the sheet in rds giving height and width of cm will only provide cm General relativity Stairway Special relativity Joseph Louis Lagrange Ordinary differential equation Diffraction Trajectory Stress (physics) Quadratic equation Boy's surface Mathematics Projective transformation Classical mechanics Jet engine Interstate Highway standards Supply and demand Particle in a box Hydrogeology Derivative Partial differential equation Great Pyramid of Giza Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Dynamical system Geodesy Numerical integration Linear differential equation Doomsday argument Original Amiga chipset Tide Random walk Torque Dirac equation Transformation problem Exact solutions in general relativity Sturm-Liouville theory Point groups in three dimensions Tire Boat building Colours, standards and guidons Space elevator Dai shogi Battery (electricity) Membrane potential Drill bit Complex number Modified Newtonian dynamics Kepler's laws of planetary motion Quartic equation Welfare economics Microeconomics Physics Maxwell's equations Amateur radio Backstroke Circuit design Buckling Nondimensionalization Action (physics) Opportunity rover M__bius strip Electricity pylon Volleyball Wood Luminiferous aether Einstein-Cartan theory Unicode Calculus Planetary orbit Geography of Africa Strap-on dildo Archimedes Pp-wave spacetime Table tennis RLC circuit World line Ancient Egyptian weights and measures Angular velocity Doom engine Resistor Energy Dimensional analysis Parabola Parallax Sea level rise Ship model IAR 80 Antenna (radio) Radar Car handling Mathematics of general relativity Van Stockum dust Finite element method Airport Archery Conic section Vedic mathematics Coriolis effect Derivation of the partition function
