the techniques for solving linear equations and linear inequalities are similar yet different explain and gi the techniques for solving linear equations and linear inequalities are similar yet different explain and give an example of both a linear equation and a linear inequality that demonstrates this difference when solving a linear inequality treat it like an equation the only difference is when multiplying and dividing by a negative take the opposite of the sign if it's less than change it to greater than another difference is in the graphing with linear equations the graph will always be a solid line with linear inequalities your line may be solid less than or equal to or greater than or equal to or dashed less than or greater than also you must shade one side because an inequality includes points not on the line Inequality Trigonometric function Conic section Derivative Linear equation Welfare economics Quadratic equation Elementary algebra Microeconomics Complex number Ordinary differential equation Dirac equation Quartic equation Joseph Louis Lagrange Computational fluid dynamics Projective transformation Numerical analysis Absolute value Quantum harmonic oscillator Intelligence quotient Economic inequality Lebesgue integration Legendre transformation Determinant Linear algebra Fluctuation theorem Discrete Fourier transform Linear differential equation Multiple integral Square root Linear combination Electrical network Recurrence relation Linear Slope Aberration in optical systems Algorithm Partial differential equation Gaussian elimination Heat equation Linear regression Traveling salesman problem Finite element method Dynamical system Daubechies wavelet Random walk Sturm-Liouville theory Force Radar Trigonometric identity Trajectory Least squares State space (controls) Supply and demand Parabola Vector (spatial) Maxwell's equations Yield curve Circuit design Quaternion Inequality of arithmetic and geometric means Mathematics Particle in a box Two-body problem Magnetic field Timeline of mathematics Resistor Basel problem Combinatorial species Stationary point XSL attack Cissoid of Diocles Geodesy Diophantine equation Calculus Matrix (mathematics) Simplex algorithm Factor analysis Operational amplifier Exponentiation Bose gas Computer representation of surfaces False position method Mass spectrometry Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics) Denotational semantics Exponential function Expected value Planetary orbit Mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics Einstein-Cartan theory Self-adjoint operator Rendering (computer graphics) Lotka-Volterra equation Local hidden variable theory Affine transformation
