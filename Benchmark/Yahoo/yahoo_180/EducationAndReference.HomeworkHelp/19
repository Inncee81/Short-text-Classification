can someone please explain these algebra problems to me i would appreciate any help on showing me how these are done i have been out of school for over years thank you combine like terms d d which of the following is not an expression a m w b m w c w m d w m write the following phrase using symbols use the variable x to represent the number less than a number did i do this one right answer x for this one all you have to do is turn the minus sign in front of the d into a plus sign and then carry over the minus sign to still be attached to the d so d d d my guess for this one is b because i don't know how to minus and divide something simultaneously i'm nearly positive you are correct don't overthink it less than a number can only be x Plus and minus signs Boolean logic Polynomial Two's complement Elementary algebra Boolean algebra Complex number Grade (education) Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace P-adic number Computer numbering formats Philosophy of language On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Binary numeral system GED Pascal's triangle Derivative Addition Function (mathematics) Permutation Gravity Mathematics G__del's incompleteness theorem Augustus De Morgan Set Lambda calculus Newton's identities Dimensional analysis Elementary arithmetic Formal power series Continued fraction Representations of Clifford algebras Quantum mechanics Series (mathematics) ___1 (number) Quartic equation Basel problem Exponentiation Surreal number Dash Mathematics of general relativity Axiom Speech synthesis Halting problem Algebraic geometry Exterior algebra Apollo Guidance Computer Linear algebra Decimal American Sign Language Lorentz group Vector (spatial) Identical particles Compiler optimization Normal distribution Probability Negation Philosophy of mathematics Dice Maxwell's equations Common Lisp Crossword Australian electoral system Division by zero Digital circuit Alfred Korzybski Combinatory logic Calculus The Princeton Review Quantification Prime number Bulgarian language Chess terminology Exponential function Integral Renormalization Method of complements Shit Algebra Riemann integral Chinese character Vedic mathematics Numeral system Wheel of Fortune I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Clifford algebra Bitwise operation Gaussian elimination Quaternion Book of Revelation American and British English differences Spinor IP (complexity) Pattern matching Signed number representations Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster Joseph Louis Lagrange Brave New World
