help with math please could someone check and to see if they are correct question i don't understand can someone tell me how to do it so i can get the answer myself find the prime factorization of use your calculator to evaluate the following expression if x and y and z round your answer to the nearest tenth x yz a b c correct d which property of the real numbers is illustrated by the following statement a commutative property of addition correct b associative property of addition c distributive property prime factorization is reducing the problem to only prime numbers is easy in that it is x yes c is correct associative property http hotmath com hotmath help algebra properties of addition html Polynomial Boolean algebra Prime number Riemann zeta function Elementary algebra Mathematics Halting problem Complex number Complexity classes P and NP Expert system Quantum computer Algebra of sets G__del's incompleteness theorem Algebraic geometry Matrix (mathematics) GED Lattice (order) Exponentiation Formal power series Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Pi Adjoint functors Bayesian inference Intelligent design Ideal class group P-adic number On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences Greatest common divisor Philosophy of mathematics Field (mathematics) Associative algebra Computer numbering formats Integer factorization Orthogonal matrix Associativity Fermat's last theorem Compiler optimization Philosophy of language JavaScript Quaternion Normal distribution Lebesgue integration Education in Romania Combinatorics Calculus XML TI-89 series Group (mathematics) Chern class Carmichael number Fast Fourier transform Distributivity Vector space Domain Name System Fibonacci number Ordinary differential equation Logic Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Probability Hyperreal number Elementary arithmetic Annuity Abstraction (computer science) Orders of magnitude (numbers) Quantum mechanics UBASIC Continued fraction Integral Category theory Computer algebra system Basel problem Logarithm Galois theory Microeconomics Transformation problem Natural number ALGOL 68 Commutative ring Octonion Prime ideal Computational complexity theory RSA Zero-knowledge proof Boolean prime ideal theorem Crossword Elliptic curve World Wide Web Real number NP (complexity) Lambda calculus Python programming language Visual Basic Lie algebra Determinant Interpretation of quantum mechanics Ideal (ring theory) Discrete Fourier transform Natural deduction
