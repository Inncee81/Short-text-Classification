is ap calculus worth it let's say that i wanted to major in something math and science related and i take ap calculus my senior year would it be worth it because i've heard from some people that even if you pass the ap test you won't get credited as much because the basic calculus is required in college for all math related majors it depends on the college but generally you will be given some credit for taking ap calculus and getting a or a on the test i'm majoring in math and i got hours of credit the first two semesters of calculus for my score of on the ap calc bc exam i don't have to retake any of the courses so i am jumping right into multivariate calculus as a freshman this fall sometimes people decide to relinquish the credit they receive through the ap calc exams and retake the course so that they can get a better knowledge of the subject maybe that's what you heard people talking about also even if you did have to retake your calculus in your college ap calculus would give you an edge over all your other peers you'll be prepared enough to earn the highest grades your college calculus course would be a gpa booster if you took ap calc seriously in high school if you are worried about having to do a ton of work ap calculus ab is the way to go there is still a lot of work but it's not nearly as hard as bc is Advanced Placement Program Grade (education) Education in Romania Education in the United States Graduate school Jaime Escalante A-level Calculus Stuyvesant High School GED SAT Education in Germany Test (student assessment) Physician Hunter College High School Education in Taiwan Mathematics Clements High School High school National Certificate of Educational Achievement College admissions Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy Law School Admissions Test Junior Certificate Franklin W.
