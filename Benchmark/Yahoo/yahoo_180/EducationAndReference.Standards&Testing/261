sending ap scores hi i was wondering if i should send my ap score report to all the colleges i am applying to i will be a senior this coming school year and i did fairly well passed all of them ap scores are generally used more for placement and credit than for admission they'll look more at what classes you've taken and the grades you've gotten in them that's the general theory anyway the fact that you've taken ap classes shows your commitment to your education regardless of what you get on the tests they'll look at your test grades when you go to enroll to see what classes you place in for college i personally did go ahead and send my scores to the schools i applied to it does reflect well on you if you've scored high on them from what i ve heard some colleges will look at ap scores in the admissions process and others won t it would mainly matter if you get a high grade in the class but failed the ap test because that would reflect badly on you likewise if you got a lower grade in the class but a high grade on the exam it might mitigate the negative of a lower gpa to a certain extent since you did well it can t hurt anything so i d say go ahead and send them http www collegeboard com student testing ap exgrd html there is a fee to send them though so if you re going to take more tests your senior year you might want to just wait and have the scores sent for free when you fill out the paperwork for ap tests next spring or just send them to your top choices Grade (education) College admissions Education in the United States SAT Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement Law school Affirmative action GED Education in Romania Hunter College High School High school Education in Hong Kong Education in Taiwan A-level Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in Germany Education in Malaysia Standardized testing Numerus clausus New Trier High School Lynbrook High School Secondary education in the United States IB Diploma Programme Jeopardy!
