how long are praxis i scores valid for i was thinking of taking the test soon for future grad schools but was also thinking of taking a year or two off to live and work overseas before i apply to grad schools would the scores still be valid in a year or two or is there an expiration date should i just take them now or when i get back thanks that's a good question different states have different guidelines for the praxis test the best advice i can give you is to check with the ed department at the university or college that you are looking to attend and ask them they should be able to steer you in the right direction hope this helps Graduate school GED Advanced Placement Program Extreme Programming Education in Romania Driver's license SAT Standardized testing Education in the People's Republic of China Jak II Quizbowl Notary public Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Appeal College admissions Article Five of the United States Constitution Affirmative action Pretty Good Privacy Test (student assessment) Walt Disney World College Program Graphology New York State Department of Education Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Education in the United States British National (Overseas) - Hong Kong Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Logic Karl Rove Teacher Traditional Chinese medicine Article One of the United States Constitution Quantitative marketing research Doomsday argument Public education Charmed Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Parapsychology Jaime Escalante Visa (document) German car number plates President of Ireland Model (economics) History of Test cricket (1890 to 1900) Student loan Year 2000 problem Grade (education) Education in Germany Model (abstract) Condom American football Dynamic Systems Development Method Ice hockey RFID Sydney Riot of 1879 History of Test cricket (to 1883) USA PATRIOT Act Rice University Charter school Law School Admissions Test Florida State University Scientific method Plame affair Coming of Age (TNG episode) Debugging United States Constitution Three Laws of Robotics Neuro-linguistic programming Psychometrics Juris Doctor Establishment Clause of the First Amendment Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Jeopardy!
