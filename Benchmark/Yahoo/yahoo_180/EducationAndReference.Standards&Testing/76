how many times can you take the sat i what i've always heard is that you can only take the sat i three times then this uc riverside professor told me you can take the sat i infinite times and then my friend told me you can take infinite times but colleges take the average after the third time could you guys please give me a definite answer it is possible for you to take it as many times as you want or rather as many times as you have time to take it and as many times as it is offered while you're in high school and sometimes before then i took it once a year in high school so times so it's a fact that you can take it more than times but that misconception comes from the idea that you shouldn't take it more than times but how colleges look at it does depend on the college i don't think any place really takes an average but they can see all of your scores on the score report you send them and it's sometimes frowned upon for students to take it more than about three times on the theory that the sat is in part as test of how well you know the sat so if you take it many many times you will eventually get so used to the test that your score will be higher than your actual aptitude that is the theory although they in general also hold that your score will stay in the same range over time if nothing changes i e if you don't study more but the best study you can get for the sat is the sat itself in any case some colleges will superscore your sat scores by taking the highest score from each section rather than just your highest total score in one sitting and they are less likely to do this or they will think less favorably of you while doing this if you've taken it many many times in theory it is more circumstantial than that though for example taking it once a year is different than taking it times in one year i really don't think from what i've heard that it's that bad to take it more than times especially if you continue to increase your scores and if you eventually get the score you want that at least is what i understand of the matter what i've been told and what i've heard so you definitely can take it many times but you don't want to take it too many times good luck SAT Test (student assessment) Juris Doctor Grade (education) GED Theory of conduct Batting average National Certificate of Educational Achievement Graduate school Law school Intelligence quotient American and British English differences Sex and intelligence Advanced Placement Program Victorian Certificate of Education Causality Plame affair Academia Epistemology Quizbowl Doomsday argument Appeal Lebesgue integration Logic Education in Hong Kong The Princeton Review PSAT/NMSQT Law School Admissions Test Infinity The nature of God in Western theology Music The Amber Spyglass College admissions Series (mathematics) Avenue Q Ra (board game) Philosophy of language Economics Affirmative action Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) Education in Germany Scientific method Dynamical system Social rule Gravity Sydney Riot of 1879 Martial art Friedrich Schleiermacher ELO rating system Supply and demand College Craps Normal distribution Race and intelligence Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) IQ and the Wealth of Nations Factor analysis Education in the People's Republic of China Education in Taiwan Distribution (mathematics) Community college Graduate Record Examination Marshall McLuhan Mathematics Randomness Lawyer Scientology beliefs and practices The Shining (film) Medical school John Cage University of California, Riverside Education in Romania English grammar Stuyvesant High School Fibonacci number Student loan Hearsay Species Gliding Democracy Bernard Williams Special relativity God Go ranks and ratings Islamic philosophy Standardized testing Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Transactional analysis Court system of Canada Black hole U.S. Electoral College Philosophy of science Trigonometric function Autism rights movement Education in Australia Hearts (game) Meme
