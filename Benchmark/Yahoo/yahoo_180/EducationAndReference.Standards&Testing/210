is an iq of good for a year old is a very respectable iq score at any age although nearly impossible to measure one's 'true iq' does not vary with age iq stands for intelligence quotient and is calculated by dividing 'intellectual age' by 'chronological age' real age the result is then multiplied by for instance suppose a year old is determined to have the intelligence of a typical year old then this person's iq is given by iq intellectual age actual age x x x this person's iq indicates less than average intelligence in your case a twelve year old with iq has an intellectual age equivalent to that of a fifteen year old to see this we substitute for actual age and for iq in the iq equation giving intellectual age x the intellectual age that makes this a true statement is years it should be noted that an iq test score is an approximation to 'true' iq as such one's test score can vary by some ten or so points upon different testings thus the twelve year old in question likely has true iq somewhere between and variability notwithstanding is a very good score by any account average being regards rich b SAT Intelligence quotient Continued fraction Derivative Race and intelligence Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace Factor analysis Causality Grade (education) Transformation problem EPR paradox Polynomial Intelligence (trait) Trigonometric function Probability ELO rating system Gaussian elimination Finite element method Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Circuit design Race and intelligence (Culture-only or partially-genetic explanation) National Certificate of Educational Achievement Gravity IQ and the Wealth of Nations Explosive material Standard deviation Quartic equation Money Resistor GED Identical particles Complex number Quantum mechanics Orthogonal matrix Calculus Entropy Chinese calendar G__del's incompleteness theorem Nondimensionalization Supply and demand Hyperreal number Doomsday argument Fuel injection Falsifiability Expert system Microeconomics Production theory basics Sex and intelligence Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Mass Force Collision detection Slander and libel Path integral formulation Batting average Race and intelligence (Average gaps among races) M__bius transformation Annuity Binary numeral system Infinity Vacuous truth Graduate Record Examination Phase-locked loop Division (mathematics) Margin of error Ordinary differential equation Formal power series Multiple integral Atheism Kepler's laws of planetary motion Pseudoscience Variance Mental retardation Marilyn vos Savant Function (mathematics) Psychometrics Compiler optimization Faster-than-light Artificial neural network Doomsday rule Scientific method Membrane potential Determinant Clifford algebra Special relativity Neil Postman Experiment Quantitative marketing research Tax Coriolis effect Contract Exponentiation Lambda calculus Kalman filter Square root Epistemology Prime number Operational amplifier
