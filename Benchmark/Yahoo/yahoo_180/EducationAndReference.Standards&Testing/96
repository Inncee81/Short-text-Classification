national merit scholarship i'm going to be a sophomore in the fall and in october i will take the psat i know that it's out of but what are the chances of qualifying for the scholarship what is the minimum score you would need to get on the test to be qualified does your gpa factor into the result are my results going to be matched up to my school or my district or my county my school is kind of different everybody takes the psat in sophomore year i don't even know if we take it again in junior year by then everybody is too busy studying for the sat anyway so i really think this year's results really count how can i find out my state cutoff i live in california so maybe it's lower also sophomore results from the psat don't count toward the national merit qualifying test first you can only qualify for national merit your junior year the psat was actually made for juniors but a lot of school districts have started having the sophomores take it for extra practice without actually explaining to them that its function as the nmsqt only applies to juniors my school did this second the psat only qualifies you as a semifinalist after that you have to fill out a packet of paperwork to qualify for finalist standing the information you give includes gpa high school transcript one recommendation and a student written essay you also have to submit scores from the real sat but of semifinalists become finalists those who don t are usually i think only those who fill out the paperwork wrong or perhaps if you absolutely bombed the sat or a few other things from finalist standing it becomes a bit iffy only about of the about finalist become national merit scholars to go from finalist standing to being a scholar they do look at gpa what you took in high school your recommendations your essay and so on but i think one of the most important parts is your sat score nmsc s website http www nationalmerit org nmsp php that site will tell you your chances of the million entrants some with the highest psat nmsqt selection index scores critical reading mathematics writing skills scores qualify for recognition in the national merit scholarship program then in early september about students or approximately one third of the high scorers are notified that they have qualified as semifinalists third the cutoffs for semifinalist change from year to year and are different in each state because it s the highest x i don t remember in each state you can see some of the recent years cutoffs in different states here http talk collegeconfidential com showthread php t and here http talk collegeconfidential com showpost php p postcount those used to be posted and were copied and pasted from here http hseagle sas edu sg hscounseling tests nationalmeritselectionindices htm but they no longer post them there because of copyright issues you might find other years cutoffs on talk collegeconfidential com since they try to compile them each year but those were the ones i found first and they ll give you an idea of what you need to aim for semifinalist designation from psat score cutoffs are determined on a state to state basis i m pretty sure after that it s a national thing so all the finalists are in the same pool i can t remember and i can t tell it s a pain in the rear to find any definitive useful information on nmscs website and i have tried good luck if you have any more questions about national merit i d be happy to try to answer them i spent my whole senior year a bit confused about all of it lol GED Scholarship Grade (education) College admissions Advanced Placement Program National Certificate of Educational Achievement Graduate school Education in the People's Republic of China Education in the United States Affirmative action Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology Quizbowl Theory of conduct Economics PHP Education in Germany Montgomery Blair High School CPU cache New Trier High School Illinois Mathematics and Science Academy United States Academic Decathlon Intelligence quotient New York Knicks Norway national football team Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Standardized testing United States of America Mathematical Olympiad Test (student assessment) Normal distribution Jeopardy!
