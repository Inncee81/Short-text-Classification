for lsat is powerscore or kaplan better i would be able to buy kaplan books used still save which would only buy powerscore books this is obviously a better deal but that is only b c powerscore books are priced so much higher if they are nearly equal i would like to save the but if everyone knows something i don't powerscore is better i might shell out the money also if i was only able to buy powerscore book should it be logic games bible or logical reasoning bible i am a big powerscore fan and their course and books helped me score in the s i did use two kaplan books and i think their lsat is decent but imho if you can only buy two books make them the powerscore books lsat prep is not the place to skimp and if those books can get you extra points they are worth every penny think about it this way they are probably priced higher because they are worth more others here will certainly concur if you can only afford one book then it depends on which of the two sections is giving you the most trouble a lot of people have trouble with the games so if you are in that same boat grab the lg bible if it is lr and rc that give you trouble the lr bible is the better choice take a few tests two actual tests can be downloaded for free from lsat com to get a sense of which section is more difficult for you probably you will find that after getting one book you will want the other best of luck SAT Microeconomics Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ra (board game) Kaplan Baseball Stars Medical College Admission Test The Princeton Review Poker jargon Supply and demand Winning Streak Overclocking Money Capitalism MapleStory Monopoly (game) $ale of the Century Inflation FairTax Game show Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME The Joker's Wild Education in the United States Enron Corporation ELO rating system Pump It Up A Course In Miracles United States dollar PLATO Capital accumulation Sears Holdings Corporation Estoppel Betting (poker) Contract bridge Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Spiritism Diving Yao Ming Jewish philosophy Final Fantasy XI New York Knicks Jeopardy!
