my poem memories comments as i watch the river flow i m blinded by its charcoal glow i close my eyes and think real deep of all my thoughts i chose to keep from my childhood i will go year by year and going slow seems the years have gone by we all do know they seem to fly year by year i see a trait how this came to be my fate we all do seem do be the way that we were treated day by day as i stop to reminisce of that first girl i did kiss i told my friends and they did jest that she said i was the best then i skip ahead some years with new friends and drinking beers glad these days are in my past or my body wouldn t last if i could change some things back then i m sure i would have one more friend we all hurt people in our past didn t know how long it last there are things we can not change there s no way to rearrange i tell myself that life goes on is that really being wrong now there is my second wife showing me a brand new life showing me just how to be living life more humblely i live my life more day by day so when god looks down he smiles my way i do good things now that are right i sure sleep better now at night good to read glad you found your piece Sin City Humphrey Bogart Negima Shaggy dog story Pitaten The Amber Spyglass The Catcher in the Rye Marilyn Monroe The Shining (film) EastEnders One Tree Hill (TV series) Jon Secada W.I.T.C.H.
