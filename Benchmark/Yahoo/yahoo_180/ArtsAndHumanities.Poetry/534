undeniable love time has passed lyk an hourglass it's slipping out slipping out my hand i wish der was a way to make it stop what it does to me i can no longer stand i didn't expect that it wud be like dis just like honey but it tears me apart didn't realize i've fallen just dis hard but i can't deny who owns my heart why did you ever come in my life why did i ever see your face so bryt it's hard to stay like this be friends i'd be blind than to hurt with you in syt i know you're not for me i'm not for you but why does it feel so good so ryt afraid to see you touch you or hear you i'd have to squeeze this beating hart so tight i can't fall for you i shouldn't fall you can't be mine but you have my hart life's so unfair why is fate so cruel why did i know love from the very start i wish i could yell for the world to hear you are my life my soul and my fear you make me smile oh you make me cry but in my heart its you i hold so dear it's good it has alot of feeling but just a tiny friendly tip when u post a poem try not to abreviate things so much it's a little distracting when you have to take time to analyze dis for this instead of taking in the poem but anyway i like it maybe you could add to it a little more why not explain somehow why the two of u r not good each other The Amber Spyglass Pitaten Jon Secada Incarnations of Immortality Kodocha Social rule Infinite Ryvius Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban One Tree Hill (TV series) Rent (musical) W.I.T.C.H.
