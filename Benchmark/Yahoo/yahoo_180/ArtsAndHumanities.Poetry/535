my amatuer poem criticism please thanks i'm an amatuer i based this on the meanings and metaphors of my lyrics and rhyming i wrote this for a small scholarship please give criticism as i play the game which started as fun my eyes darken my heartbeat speeds up i become a monster a beast protecting the goal like a child i must not lot a ball in or it will eat me away like wild i use my body as a shield for the netted cage sacrificing myself so that no points will be made breaking bones bleeding and taking pain i persevere through as long as i can defend for my team soccer is my passion playing it is a dream slowly earning respect and trust from men i prove myself as if every game is my last one i play my heart out so no regrets can be made i'm like the sun covering players with rays like a cheetah waiting to pounce watching the ball's every bounce when the whistle blows i am proud the end of the game listening to the crowd they will cheer for my name soon once i hit pro's and soar as high as the moon damn you people are harsh huh haha whatever to the girl that said sometimes it seemed not to rhyme thats probably from listening to rap so i'm used to words that almost rhyme that you have to rhyme yourself i would call it football but alot of people get confused and think i am talking bout american football i play defender i like this poem and it takes lot for me such thing the only thing that i thought i would add are some of sense the you seem to be missing is touch smell and taste but other wise it's a good start i hope that you didn't send this end yet though but if you add those sense in somewhere then this poem will go even further and i did like the language used in this poem it reminded me of mogwai Football (soccer) Volleyball New York Giants Norway national football team Baseball Water polo Football 1957 World Series Rugby union Poker jargon Canadian football Glossary of American football Time Out of Mind Extreme Programming Jack Charlton Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Ice hockey Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Badminton GunBound Comparison of Canadian and American football Social rule Rugby league Australian rules football Hip hop rivalries Boxing Cleveland Browns Tag Darken Rahl Peter Shilton Naruto jutsu Ultimate (sport) Piccolo Junior Saga Dominoes Paintball Bryan Robson Jon Secada Babe Ruth Paradise Lost Table tennis Lacrosse Professional wrestling match types Field hockey Tennis Blood (computer game) Snooker Softball Pinball Cincinnati Bengals Book of Isaiah American football strategy Football (soccer) positions National Football League Lore Four square God Emperor of Dune Quarashi Jabberwocky Hip hop music Hurling Boston Red Sox Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Aquemini Theory of conduct Arena football Sydney Riot of 1879 Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Denji Sentai Mega Ranger Shaggy dog story Laws of cricket Ty Cobb Sudden death Alex Ferguson The Lovely Bones Cricket The Marshall Mathers LP New England Patriots Team Fortress Classic Four Quartets Pittsburgh Steelers Sandy Koufax Basketball Team handball 2004 American League Championship Series Red Hot Chili Peppers Super Bowl XXV Fast bowling 2005 World Series
