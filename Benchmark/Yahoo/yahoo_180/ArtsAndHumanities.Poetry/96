poem a kiss in the rain let me know what you think i hear the rain on the window sill and my thoughts go straight to you reflecting back on the day that i knew your feelings were true running my fingers across my lips remembering our first kiss in the rain and my heart beats faster and begins to ache but not in pain i can still envision the laughter we shared as you pulled me into the storm and held me tight up against you to keep me warm pressing your lips up against mine as around us the raindrops fell breathing in the scent of you was enough to put me under your spell now everytime the thunder rolls and the lightning flashes bright i remember how i fell in love one amazing stormy night despite what others thought i thought it was amazing poetry is meant to be what you want it to be poetry doesn't have limitations but it has only one rule make it your own and you made this poem yours and that's what impressed me the most you have a bright future ahead of you and this is definitely one of the best poems i've read on here try publishing with poetry com so you can compete for prizes keep on writing i believe in you you can go very far superstar Blood on the Tracks Desire (album) Jon Secada Time Out of Mind Emily Dickinson Rainbow Poetry Rain Indianapolis 500 Professional wrestling throws Poker jargon Professional wrestling holds The Amber Spyglass Charles Bukowski Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sin City Dean Koontz USS Tunny (SS-282) Mercury Atlas 6 Negima Waka Lightning Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Marilyn Monroe Clarinet Cliff Richard Ten Commandments Beat generation Sonic the Hedgehog Janet Jackson Book of Isaiah Alfred Edward Housman Bob Dylan Tenshinhan Humphrey Bogart Empire Burlesque Salad Fingers 24 Hours of Le Mans English poetry Socrates E.
