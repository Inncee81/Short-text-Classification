how about you are instead of i am it's a little something i wrote years ago enjoy you are you are my love you are my life you are my love so true you are the woman that i love you are the color blue you are the sweetheart of my dreams you are my pride and joy you are a woman through and through you are no rich man's toy you are the apple of my eye you are the one i crave you are the one who tells to me you are my loving slave you are my cooing turtle dove you are my honey pie you are my breath of clean fresh air you are the deep blue sky you are the heart within my chest you are my spark of life you are the blood that flows through me you are my special wife you are the softness in my heart you are the kindness too you are the only girl for me my darling i love you this one strictly for fun and anyone can pick pick pick you see i didn't quit my day job lol you know because of the way you asked the question i'm reading it as i am my love i am my life which of course sounds very conceited and the question leaves it as an either or sort of thing which is unrealistic if not unhealthy the other thing is it hearkens up the old stevie wonder song you are the sunshine of my life which i really don't think you want to do because comparison is next and yours is most definitely on the losing end of that deal there are some other problems aside for the constant jackhammer repetition of this poem you are my special wife you mean the one you break out for when company comes and i can't help but ask how does this make your non special everyday common wife feel um and since we are on the particulars you are my loving slave ain't seen many of those yes i'm sure it happens but wouldn't it be more desirable to have someone of free will to love you oh mr lincoln paging mr lincoln you are the color blue okay why is that so great now aside from this the underlying tone of this poem is not an equal partner but an object or possession i'm sure you didn't mean to imply this well i hope you didn't but there you have it no where in this poem do you talk about her as a person who thinks and has emotions of her own and a dark side or a bad day or a anything that isn't directly a thing for you to enjoy you may want to take a moment and contemplate that especially before you give it to her know what you're saying on all levels before you say it sort of thing good luck Jon Secada The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll The Shining (film) Pitaten Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind John Berryman The McGuire Sisters Social rule Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan Blood on the Tracks EastEnders The Ashlee Simpson Show Meaning of life Hall & Oates Blonde on Blonde Shaggy dog story Care Bears Salad Fingers Avenue Q Sinfest The Amber Spyglass Fiddler on the Roof William Shakespeare Milton H.
