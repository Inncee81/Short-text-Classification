opinions on a poem please i wrote this with the style of the lines rather than the complexities the phrases in mind in other words i know it's straight forward the last line of each stanza should be indented titled uncharacteristic my hands tremble like leaves my heart races faster still thoughts of you play continuously i yearn for your arms enwrap my shaken body never let go but i said no your eyes lock upon my own your face holds a daring expression soft lips kiss my shaken hands then caress past my cupids bow stay like this but i said no kissing my forehead and cheeks my brow furrows in wonderment can this truly be real conceive it is but i said no doubt dances upon my troubled mind a hazy picture of what was it is wrong i ll never say no again you're off to a very good start i liked the specificity of the work the attempt to capture the magic of the moment and the necessity to make a decision i enjoyed the declination of the lines very nice visual effect especially in free verse and three call outs use a different word than shaking in one of these lines and keep the verbs active shaking body shaking hands and try to change the yoda speak conceive it is very nice thank you for sharing your work Swingout Salute Shaggy dog story Parsifal Bulgarian language Bowing (social) The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Gesture Miss Saigon Cupid and Psyche Sabbath Sonnet Volleyball Bhagavad Gita Jon Secada Customs and etiquette of Japan Characters of Naruto Poker jargon Aikido Sign language The Parting of the Ways Professional wrestling holds Narrator Lindy Basic Milton H.
