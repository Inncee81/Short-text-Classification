how literate are you in poetry in promotion of actual knowledge of established poetic tradition to counterbalance the overabundance of questions from would be poets seeking needy validation for their personal poems i'll give best answer status to the person who first answers all questions below satisfactorily i already know the answer to the first four so it's that's make or break as your subjective response make it cogent and articulate what are the three basic types or modes of poetry provide names and definitions name one elizabethan poet one romantic poet and one modernist poet what is prosody who is the current poet laureate for the us how is poetry relevant to you in a st century society obviously can have several answers just make sure you match the poet's name to the appropriate era thank you to those who gave such thorough responses even those with dissenting viewpoints my point in promoting this q a session is to promote a foray into the grand tradition of poetry which seems all too infrequent in the poetry yahoo answers section for those of you who suspect me of pedantry or pretentiousness i find myself slightly amused for two reasons first some of those same people seem to have no qualms establishing their own poetic credentials to assume a position of authority this leads me to my second point engaging poetry at a certain caliber does often require people esoteric knowledge poetry writers and readers alike should take the time to know the tradition from which the art form derives just because someone learns to play four or five chords on a guitar doesn't make him or her an accomplished musician sorry to say and as far as my particular q a session being the litmus test for who'd be a good reader or writer of poetry i never claimed nor would ever claim such a foolish thing i wanted to engage people with like minded background knowledge of the poetic tradition and maybe encourage those who weren't as familiar into a little research and as to my stance on free verse some seem to interpret my insistence on a knowledge of poetic tradition to be a condemnation of free verse untrue however free verse can be a very dangerous thing to a young poet who naively assumes it means writing whatever lines he or she wants well written free verse must follow its own internal structural demands or risk succumbing to prose writing with arbitrary line breaks and last but not least a confession i had thought that donald hall was still poet laureate not charles simic egads as socrates would indicate knowledge starts with admitting that one knows nothing what are the three basic types or modes of poetry provide names and definitions i may be off on this i m mostly self taught picking up most of my training from books my guess lyric dramatic and narrative or epic lyric poetry has song like musical qualities it tends to focus on emotions shakespeare s sonnets or dylan thomas with do not go gently into that good night would be examples of lyric poetry dramatic poetry would be verse written in a play shakespeare and jonson would both be examples of poets using this form narrative epic poetry came from oral tradition it tells what happened rather than what is felt milton s paradise lost for example name one elizabethan poet one romantic poet and one modernist poet elizabethan chistopher marlowe romantic william blake modernist wallace stevens what is prosody prosody is when you look at both meter and rhythm sonics in a poem i guess you could say it s the study of meter and rhythm some people use this as a substitute word for scansion though i don t i ve read long articles on prosody so i know my definition is very basic here who is the current poet laureate for the us charles simic how is poetry relevant to you in a st century society it is relevant to me in the same way it has been relevant to people living in other times poetry steps beyond the practical language of life and gives you a transcendent view of a subject it helps you not just record life but recognize what matters in life poetry and literature for that matter will have a hard time remaining relevant in a culture that is largely aliterate meaning that they can read but choose not to in general society has not trained its mind to read anything more complicated than a newspaper for me though poetry remains relevant for the reasons i discussed History of literature Deconstruction Modernism Lyric poetry Irish poetry Anglo-Saxon literature Biblical poetry Restoration literature Haiku Translation Postmodernism Arabic literature Philosophy Tonality Socrates Blood on the Tracks Modernist poetry in English Walter J.
