poetry mechanics question i have a really hard time knowing how to differentiate the stresses in poetry how do i know if a word is stressed and how do i know if it's read as a light stress falling inflection right or a heavy stress rising inflection if i'm not mistaken i think i'm tone deaf annabella one quick question i am reading a book about poetry mechanics and in it the author shows examples of poems with iambic meter one thing that's really confusing me is how words like and the in at are sometimes stressed and sometimes not does it just depend on the over all rhythm of the poem yes that answers my question i learned about all of this mechanics business along time ago but then i just focused on free verse now i'd like to go back to understanding mechanics but it's proven to be a little tricky by the way i would've never guessed that you're not a native english speaker you write flawlessly if only i could write my second language that well well for me it's probably easier to know because as i am not an english native speaker i had to learn where to place the stresses in the words the english language is tonal and therefore musical a stress is marked by a higher pitch in the voice and it is also longer than a weak stress i will give you a simple example although it would be easier verbally when you say the word tradition you stress the second syllable tra di tion di is slightly longer than the other two and you voice slightly higher but if it is impossible for you to know exactly where you place the stress you can always check this in a dictionary most of them indicate where the stresses fall on line you can use http www thefreedictionary com they indicate the stress by putting an apostrophe after the stressed syllable tra di' tion good luck edit right now what you are talking about is stresses within a sentence there is the natural rhythm of the english language but poetry uses certain set rhythms a poem is a compromise between the two these small grammatical words are usually unstressed but they can be if they are part of a particular scansion and if it does not sound too artificial however a longer and significant word only has one possible stress for example in shakespeare's sonnet shall i compare thee to a summer's day the first line can be scanned as iambic pentameter although stressing to is somewhat artificial maybe an actor reading the poet would not stress it shall i compare thee to a summer's day hope i helped Iambic pentameter Vowel Chinese language Non-native pronunciations of English Tone (linguistics) Literature English language Poetry Bulgarian language Slovak language Bengali language Dutch language Welsh language Spanish language Finnish language Lyric poetry Rhyme Shakespeare's sonnets Swedish language Vietnamese language Sanskrit Romanian phonology African American Vernacular English Stress (linguistics) Sonnet Hindi Alliterative verse Singlish Hebrew language Pinyin Taiwanese (linguistics) Lojban English as an additional language Biblical poetry Gothic language Serbo-Croatian language Dictionary Speech synthesis Slovenian language Inflection Kanji Second language acquisition Finnish grammar Basque language Varieties of Arabic Tamil language Portuguese language Korean language Phoneme Greek language Esperanto phonology American English German language New Zealand English English grammar Stuttering Grave accent Translation Esperanto grammar Alexandrine Ojibwe language Vulgar Latin William Shakespeare Russian language Finnish phonology Esperanto vocabulary Regional accents of English speakers Music Latin spelling and pronunciation Crossword German grammar Romance languages Japanese language Esperanto as an international language Gender-neutral language Latin poetry Russian phonology Grammatical mood Diacritic Spanish verbs John Berryman Japanese poetry Esperanto Scottish Gaelic language Grammatical aspect Acute accent Hearing impairment Urdu Syllable
