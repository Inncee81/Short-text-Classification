what's your opinion on this poem of mine what feelings does it leave you with the grim's sanity black clouds of hail above cry your tears of ash and blood down upon me give me sanity my soul all cut and broken my black wings in blood are soken i'm standing in the ashes of old simmered flesh breathing in the tears of those i've laid to rest now crocified empty handed wishing i was upon the undead i stand in the red mist grieving wishing my wrists were bleeding knowing thier is no retrieving of my soul and sanity i know i'll never be free of the vioces in my head the little whispers of those i've bled i'm standing in the ashes at the ends of earth i jump to fly but dissapear in dried blood's dust this poem is the idea of me being the grim reaper and imagioning what my mental state would be like if i was the grim reaper though theres not much diference in the mental state of the image in the poem and that of my actual mental state which can sometimes be a scary thing but hey at least i can write a good poem about it i think you paint too grave pardon my pun a picture of death because it is not only in death we find grief but in life as well then death becomes our savior from suffering in saying this i don't mean taking ones life i only say this because i believe that in everything there is yin and yang light and darkness good and evil if you will Dead Like Me Death (personification) Blood (computer game) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Death Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem YuYu Hakusho Vampire The Amber Spyglass Arthas Menethil Races in the Warcraft universe Necronomicon Lists of heavy metal bands by genre Conan the Barbarian Tai Chi Chuan Origin belief Resurrection of Jesus Soul Shen Gong Wu Meaning of life Rei Ayanami Twisted Metal Noob Saibot Force (Star Wars) Muslim ibn Aqeel Plagues of Egypt Characters of Naruto Grief Four Quartets Yin and yang The Subtle Knife Books of Blood Piccolo Junior Saga RuneScape quests Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Dunciad Sub-Zero Pysanka Invader Zim Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Conker's Bad Fur Day Army of Darkness Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Original sin Final Fantasy: Unlimited Big Bad Beetleborgs Yoga Sutras of Patanjali Eberron Christian eschatology The Marshall Mathers LP EastEnders Scorpion (Mortal Kombat) Aladdin (1992 film) D.
