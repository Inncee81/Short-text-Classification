rd poem of the day from me looking at suicide this i confide if it wasn't so definite it would be a closer friend but since it tends to get the last word i think it's rather absurd if i were to take a gun or a blade start blasting cutting away but i would not die just continue to survive then without hesitation i would dull agony's sensation death is so final that leaves me in denial so to suicide i say goodbye title deadly thoughts st draft omg this poem is awesome i'm bipolar and this one really hits home for me well put and very nice job you know i just read these other idiots comments and you know they just dont understand for one this doesnt have to be for real its just the way ppl look at it just cuz you write a poem of suicide doesnt mean one is going to commit suicide and two these ppl just to have what it takes to appreciate good poetryt Suicide Jon Secada Seppuku The Catcher in the Rye Kodocha The Inside Sin City Kurt Cobain Incarnations of Immortality Suicide methods Budd Dwyer Paranoia Agent God Emperor of Dune Humphrey Bogart Ludwig Wittgenstein John Berryman Hamlet The Amber Spyglass Extreme Championship Wrestling Friends Ira Gershwin Reservoir Dogs Charmed Blood on the Tracks Late Night with Conan O'Brien Pitaten Piccolo Junior Saga Seto Kaiba Steven Wright Tony Hancock Kamikaze Night (book) Indianapolis 500 Columbine High School massacre Gothic metal Knots Landing The Marshall Mathers LP Roxette Jack Kerouac The Bunker Bhagavad Gita Boston Public The Star Wars Holiday Special About a Boy The Caves of Androzani Teknoman Kim Possible Yukio Mishima Book of Job Japanese funeral The Virgin Suicides Constitution of Ireland Sinfest Poetry Jonestown Eli Siegel Patrick Hillery Kill Bill Surrealist techniques David Kelly Deconstruction Characters of Naruto Grief The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film) Confidence trick Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity The Tale of Genji Time Out of Mind Samurai Power Rangers: SPD Trigun Bad Wolf Professional wrestling slang L33t programming language 2005 Bali bombings Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Suicide note Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus SMTV Live Knife USS Vestal (AR-4) O.
