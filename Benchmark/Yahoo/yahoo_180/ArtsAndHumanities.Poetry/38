what's it like to be a bird or an animal i'm not thinking what's it like to fly or any of that sort of thing i'm wondering how can you describe the just being side of the life of animals and birds is their experience of the world just like ours is just being alive a universal shared experience when i just stare up at the clouds and empty my mind am i experiencing what a bird or animal feels when it is similarly idle many people i know seem to feel that animals and birds are just automatons that just go through the set routine of their lives without any of the joy wonder or awareness that humans experience i have my doubts about this and actually suspect that a bird has a much more immediate and vivid life experience as they have presumably less distractions than the relatively sophisticated human psyche so i have no idea how one could try to envisage life as experienced by a bird or an animal and i suspect their is no mechanistic way of doing so that's why i'm here in the poetry section looking for ideas i've come to pay the pinder the other day a girl asked how terrible it must be for the fly that is stuck to flypaper and i remarked to another two dogs in the wild will fight to the death without considering the other how much horror do the beasts experience what is the capacity of each i've seen wild dogs in the jungle attacking each other i once watched the ants ravage a caterpillar the amazement is as you observe the nature of the beast you see that fear is the most primal emotion hunger and lust show themselves only when aroused the horror of being eaten alive is constant in the animal world so to be the cat you must first fear the dog then you may prowl the night for fish heads and females Garfield Charles Darwin Milton H.
