can anyone tell me how they interpret this poem the following poem is from leaves of grass by walt whitman i know that the interpretation of a poem differs from individual to individual but i just wish to gather others' opinions i was looking a long while i was looking a long while for intentions for a clew to the history of the past for myself and for these chants and now i have found it it is not in those paged fables in the libraries them i neither accept nor reject it is no more in the legends than in all else it is in the present it is this earth to day it is in democracy the purport and aim of all the past it is the life of one man or one woman to day the average man of to day it is in languages social customs literatures arts it is in the broad show of artificial things ships machinery politics creeds modern improvements and the interchange of nations all for the modern all for the average man of to day the author was at first trying to piece out information from the past history for himself for his own intentions and maybe even for his future but while looking at it or maybe just pondering by himself for a while he found out that it's not really the past that matters but the present what people do at present may someday be a past a history so what better way to prepare for the future than to make most of one's time today well that's my interpretation Walt Whitman Biblical inerrancy New Testament Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Second Vatican Council Art Greek language Meaning of life Japanese poetry William Shakespeare Religion Mythology Software engineering Romanticism Leaves of Grass Modernism Book of Mormon Historicism King James Version of the Bible Philosophy of language Judicial activism Deconstruction Flood geology Poetry of the United States Constitution of Ireland Political spectrum Book of Revelation Orthodox Judaism Storytelling Jews as a chosen people Arabic literature Eastern Orthodox Church State Sri Aurobindo Christian Reconstructionism Preterism Predestination Medieval literature Franz Boas Creationism Sociocultural evolution Halakha Urantia Sexual orientation Literary theory Origin belief Science Anglo-Saxon literature Christianity Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Literature of the United States Poetry Nakhi World government Nicene Creed Young Earth creationism Church of Christ Irish poetry Gospel of Thomas C__dmon Biblical canon History of creationism Social democracy Intellectual property Criticisms of Charismatic and Pentecostal belief Consensus decision-making Restorationism Human Discordianism Many-worlds interpretation French literature of the 19th century Mu'allaqat Postmodernism Linguistics and the Book of Mormon Time travel Creation according to Genesis International law Trinity Resurrection of Jesus Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Gettysburg Address Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act Karl Marx Thomas Carlyle Andrew Lang Tao Te Ching Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe Free will History Palestinian Bah__'__ Faith and World Religions Alcoholics Anonymous Conservatism Postmodernity Life expectancy Congress of the United States Originalism
