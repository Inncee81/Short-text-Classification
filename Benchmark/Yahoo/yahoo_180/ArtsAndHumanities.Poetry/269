feedback on creative writing piece it's been quite a while since i last wrote something but i would still like some feedback thanks in advance time in a bottle i trudge down the stairs listening to the lonely echo of my footsteps reverberating off the metallic colors of the hallways if i could save time in a bottle the soft acoustic guitar and gentle soothing male vocals flowed from eardrum to eardrum i walk the school hallways alone the bell had long past purred its final hum however the seconds the minutes the time seems to slowly pass by classes have ended and the innumerable students have slowly emptied the hallways with their chatter and vulgar obscenities i could feel the murmur of depression and hesitation thumping away in my chest like the madman s head against the padded surface of his cell door the first thing that i d like to do i fear running into him he always stays a bit after school then i see him coming up the stairs how could i not i stand still attempting to blend in with the inanimate objects of the stairwell he stares blankly at me with dark brown depths of uncertainty there is a moment of communication between us one of silence and a friendship breaking he looks away from me and continues up the stairs i am invisible to him now i do not exist then in my heart i know i know i ll never look into those brown eyes again and be filled with comfort and safety it s getting difficult to see now my vision is blurred by stairs windows and tears creating a marble esque painting before my eyes is to save every day that eternity passes away i don t think i ll ever get over this one i think to myself in between each teardrop careening down my face actually the technique of book ending this piece with croce's lyrics was very nicely done overall this piece needs to be tightened up you don't need innumerable not to mention the number is finite vulgar with obscenities sounds redundant obscenities would do the line i could feel the murmur of his cell door was nicely done but i had to read it twice could be a punctuation thing not sure you don't need a bit i could go on i just think you've got a nice skeleton here that needs editing and maybe some new flesh Shaggy dog story Columbine High School massacre Time Out of Mind Empire Burlesque Blood on the Tracks Pet Sounds Stairway The Shining (film) Glass Combine (Half-Life 2) Sin City A Day in the Life Milton H.
