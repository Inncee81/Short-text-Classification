my poem with a new twist called hate me for this if you must i come home after a long day at work with stress and fatigue burning through my back and shoulders oh the dull aching pain i sit down to dinner with my wife seeing she cooked tuna casserole tonight i take a stab at a morsel with my fork and take a bite at first it tasted great then i noticed it wasn't quite spiced quite right i shove the plate onto the floor and it slides and breaks outside my sight i get up grab her by her shoulders and began to yell at her she is shaking and in fright the good thing is she ain't putting up a fight then i look into her eyes and noticed one of them was blackened and bruised the one on the right i give her a left to complete the set i told her next time use less salt and more spice why do i have to tell this woman the same thing twice i apologize in advance for this poem i know my grammar and spelling is not the greatest and has the tendency to anger people i once again apologize in advance for my less then perfect penmanship i wrote this poem to highlight domestic abuse and the need for women's rights if you are hating me because of the poem maybe you are against women's rights uhh dude did you write this poem of actually your life or about someone elses life or did you just do this for fun whichever it is this is a really sad poem to me no woman should be treated the way you wrote the poem nobody treat everybody equally not matter how tall or small they are big or fat cute or ugly able or disabled etc everyone deserves a chance in life to live a happy life not a horrible one Equine conformation Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Little Britain Aerial (dance move) Humphrey Bogart Darth Vader The Dunciad The Shining (film) Kodocha EastEnders Shaggy dog story Tenshinhan Sin City Teen Girl Squad Eddie Guerrero Piccolo Junior Saga Dead Like Me Professional wrestling holds Jennifer Lopez Avenue Q Baldrick Conspiracy (TNG episode) Knots Landing The Inside Hip hop rivalries Professional wrestling attacks Late Night with Conan O'Brien Friends Professional wrestling throws Traumatic brain injury Fred Phelps The Marshall Mathers LP Anxiety Swingout Dog training Escape from New York Characters in the Smurfs John Berryman Theory of conduct YuYu Hakusho Invader Zim Darken Rahl Diving Blood (computer game) She Loves You Spanking Babe Ruth Garfield Boom Town (Doctor Who) Weight training Cole Porter Boston Public John Sheridan (Babylon 5) Futurama (TV series - season 4) Wedding Crashers SMTV Live Seppuku Roman eating and drinking English grammar Ty Cobb Germaine Greer The Invisibles John Lennon The Jim Rome Show Indian English "Weird Al" Yankovic Rais massacre Capital punishment The Ashlee Simpson Show Anne Rice Kasparov versus The World Rhyme Basic English Kurt Cobain Dog Ranma __ characters Shawn Michaels The Amber Spyglass The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Waking the Dragons Domestic violence Mattress Romulus and Remus Columbine High School massacre Muhammad Ali MTV Video Music Award Vegeta 2000 Australian Grand Prix Barbecue Andy Kaufman Phoebe Halliwell Rod Stewart W.I.T.C.H.
