one of my poems my family and i my family and i have been through alot my father is an alcoholic i think he feels he needs it to express himself my mother has tended to be violent ive tried everthing to calm her down nothing helps my sister is older she's and im only sixteen but for some reason she envies me with no self respect for herself my brother is lock up and put deep like an unwanted book put away in shelf my uncle going through aids drug addiction and and the worse kind of poverty as for myself i was following the foot steps of my brother and my father my better judgement some how stops me i know im young but their is now nothing that can hold me to stay in the life of the poor i'll learn from my families mistakes and make myself more okay i'm gonna ask the obvious question is this really your life if so i am so proud of you it takes a real man to realize they don't need the alcohol and trouble as far as the poem itself goes i think it is pretty good though it lacks a rhyming rhythm stay true to yourself and remember that the lord jesus christ loves you very much Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Episodes of Lost (Season 1) One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart Slow Train Coming Alcoholics Anonymous Time Out of Mind Wolfrider Days of our Lives The Brothers Karamazov Non-native pronunciations of English Rich Mullins Phoebe Halliwell Theodicy The O.C.
