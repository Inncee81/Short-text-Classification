can anyone help me find this poem i've been sent this poem by e mail a couple of times over the past several years but didn't keep it it was written by an old woman and found after her death if i'm remembering correctly a nurse from the nursing home she lived in found it and it had a running theme of when you look at me what do you see and then things like do you see the child i once was or something like that and other musings on her life i know this isn't much but i am hoping that someone else has also seen it or can find it for me i don't know where to even start to look for it it is a very moving poem and i can't believe i didn't save it when i first read it is it this one click the link below what do you see nurses what do you see what are you thinking when you're looking at me a crabby old woman not very wise uncertain of habit with faraway eyes who dribbles her food and makes no reply when you say in a loud voice i do wish you'd try who seems not to notice the things that you do and forever is losing a stocking or shoe who resisting or not lets you do as you will with bathing and feeding the long day to fill is that what you're thinking is that what you see then open your eyes nurse you're not looking at me i'll tell who i am as i sit here so still as i do at your bidding as i eat at your will i'm a small child of ten with a father and mother brothers and sisters who love one another a young girl of sixteen with wings on her feet dreaming that soon now a lover she'll meet a bride soon at twenty my heart gives a leap remembering the vows that i promised to keep at twenty five now i have young of my own who need me to guide and a secure happy home a woman of thirty my young now grown fast bound to each other with ties that should last at forty my young sons have grown and are gone but my man's beside me to see i don't mourn at fifty once more babies play around my knee again we know children my loved one and me dark days are upon me my husband is dead i look at the future i shudder with dread for my young are all rearing young of their own and i think of the years and the love that i've known i'm now an old woman and nature is cruel 'tis jest to make old age look like the fool the body it crumbles grace and vigor depart there is now a stone where i once had a heart but inside this old carcass a young girl still dwells and now and again my battered heart swells i remember the joys i remember the pain and i'm loving and living life over again i think of the years all too few gone too fast and accept the stark fact that nothing can last so open your eyes nurses open and see not a crabby old woman look closer see me Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an EastEnders Shaggy dog story Jon Secada Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Amber Spyglass Knots Landing Fire Emblem: Blazing Sword Milton H.
