do you like this poem you told me not to be so cliche so i tried something a bit different from my usual taste title the shadowing i stand alone a supernal breeze flows by as i catch my breath i close my eyes and count the seconds as they go by silence fills the air clouds engulf the sun the light sudden darkens i make no movements no words spoken rain slowly starts to pour the impossibility of summer rains grasping the opportunity overpower the sun but victory was short lived as the sun did rise again this is pretty good i can't find a line that sucks Darken Rahl Indianapolis 500 Parallax Milton H.
