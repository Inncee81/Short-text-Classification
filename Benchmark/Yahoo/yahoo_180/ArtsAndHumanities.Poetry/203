i wrote a poem appreciate it hate it whatever you please it's more aggressive but i like it anyway that isn't the question though the question is whether you do tell me what you think raise your hand if you re tired of the same old sh t raise your hand if you want it all to just quit raise your hand if your blood is burning and your soul is always and forever churning with questions unanswered and tales untold with the trials and tribulations of the young and the old raise your hand if you ve never been sold to a myth that the world is anything but cold raise your hand take a stand and never fold the streets run red with violence and crime your life can stop at the turn of a dime if someone just chooses to make it so raise your hand if you want something to change raise your hand if you don t think it is out of your range open your ears if you want to know how to end it open your eyes to see what is so clearly defined to all those that choose not to be blind stand up take a stand be a little bold let them know that you are not among the sold let them know that you demand something different something good others will rise when they see that you stood damn oh well i will admit defeat lots of cliches in here tales untold turn of a dime take a stand the repetition is unforgiving no i don't like it it's not that you can't rhyme clearly you can you just need to work harder to say what you mean i actually don't disagree with your message you're caught up in a sort of universal call to action but your words are not original if you feel really strongly about this and it appears that you do work harder at saying it in a way that is fresh Poker jargon Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Theory of conduct Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story!
