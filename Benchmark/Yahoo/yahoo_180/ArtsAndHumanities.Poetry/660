can i get critique on a poem from all the writers out there i wrote this poem a few minutes ago and i was wondering if i could get honest constructive criticism i know i'll need a re write but if i could get suggestions on what needs changing that would be great thanks time hands travel across the face second by second minute by minute the shriek of metal on time worn wood stop the ticking fades a melody of silence so perfect caught in a moment a memory how i envy the life of a clock each second anew each minute gliding on toward the future an endless wave of time that clock cannot rewind the tape upon which we ve recorded our lives cannot return to a time counted prior to the current page nor the part of the story yet untold a part written continuously forever with those hands that face the eternal ticking of time kelsey g i like the first two paragraphs the most very nice the third is good but less clear to me i'd also love to see a binding statement maybe something stated at the beginning and reflected upon at the end a phrase a thought or a sentiment it's very good i hope that you fine tune whatever is bothering you about it and submit it for review somewhere Hey Jude Blood on the Tracks Big Ben Christian eschatology The Time Machine The Wonderful Wizard of Oz Conway's Game of Life The Amber Spyglass Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Four Quartets Planet Waves Violin Shaggy dog story The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Extreme Programming Mattress Hidden track Cliff Richard The Dalek Invasion of Earth Time The McGuire Sisters Avenue Q Paradise Lost Samuel Beckett The Beach Boys Oasis (band) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Guqin STS-114 Church of Christ, Scientist Charles Dickens Originalism Maimonides Imagism Russian joke Predestination paradox Time travel Sin City D.
