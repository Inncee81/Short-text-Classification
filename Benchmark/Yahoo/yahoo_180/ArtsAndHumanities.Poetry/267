just a poem comments welcome a look to the sky and question why it lies to me again a talk with the sun then beg it to come and burn away my pain a visit from clouds i scream aloud they wash by like a sea and in the night i take to flight with vultures after me then at dawn i look forlorn solace escapes the horizon and in the rays i count the days delivered in derision picturesque or grotesque it's striking in the least but soon i'll swoon under the moon to let those vulture feast very visual work you evoke a picture of lonliness and pain in the mind a desire to escape i love the clouds line kind of edgar allen poe'ish i like it a lot Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Darth Vader Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Sun Sky Edgar Allan Poe Chronology of Jesus Aurora (astronomy) Venus Moon Love and Theft The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Mercury (planet) The Raven Edgar Award Notable lines in the Star Wars series Islamic calendar Jupiter A Series of Unfortunate Events Solar system Symbolism (arts) Hipparchus (astronomer) Galveston Hurricane of 1900 Aztec mythology Cassini-Huygens Timeline of alternative rock Equinox Four Quartets Horror film The Amber Spyglass Sextant Solar eclipse Blood (computer game) The Twelve Labours Second Battle of El Alamein Neptune Rayleigh scattering The Hobbit Boba Fett The Penultimate Peril Extraterrestrial skies The Vile Village Rainbow John Henry Cardinal Newman Mid-Autumn Festival Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic science fiction Orion (mythology) Charles Baudelaire Obi-Wan Kenobi Darken Rahl History of modern literature Tom Jones (singer) Miss Saigon Vladimir Peter Tytla Month 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Time Out of Mind Earth Qiyamah The Star Wars Holiday Special Zodiac Dean Koontz Sunset Il Trovatore Nebula Award for Best Novelette Solar power USS The Sullivans (DD-537) USS Washington (BB-56) Odyssey The Beatles Japanese mythology Aztec TV-FM DX Deluge (mythology) The Inside Academy Award for Best Art Direction Arthur Schopenhauer Hera USS Ray (SS-271) Resurrection of Jesus Sharon Tate Thomas Ligotti Deep Impact (space mission) Huygens probe Big Day Out Hell Jiddu Krishnamurti Piccolo Junior Saga __douard Manet One Piece minor characters Another Side of Bob Dylan Michael Brecker Science fiction film Opportunity rover The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) Vlad III Dracula Surrealism Rei Ayanami
