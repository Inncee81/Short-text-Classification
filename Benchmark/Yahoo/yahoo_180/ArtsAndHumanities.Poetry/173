is it just me or does this poem i wrote sound very uneven it seems to speed up so much the clock stops ticking i stand her listening to what nothing my black suit covers my exhausted body the color describing the event before my return i cannot hear you though i can feel your presence though i know your existence is well beyond my reach where have you gone answer me aren't you thankful that i've witnessed your departure that i cared for where you disappeared into mid light did you see me erect upon the grass not lying adjacent to you did your wish for my warmth to bring life to your flesh the life i would have given you was what you desired of me how can the darkness commingle with the light i do not and will never exist as you did my jar of life is filled with filth from my garden the clock stopped ticking this very hour make it tick once more i wanted you i needed you your light is gone the clock stops ticking i stand her i listen yeah it does a bit the way to slow the poem down is by lengthening your lines short lines fast long lines slow try altering your lines a bit and see if that doesn't clear it up Equine conformation The Amber Spyglass The Time Machine Non-native pronunciations of English Mattress Internal ballistics Tick Time dilation Fast bowling Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Meriones unguiculatus Rocky Mountain spotted fever USS Tunny (SS-282) Hey Jude She Loves You Gravitational collapse Swimming Escapement Digital circuit Yoga Sutras of Patanjali A Day in the Life Black hole Origin belief Michel Henry Shadow the Hedgehog CPU cache Death Marching band Ten Commandments The Suffering (game) World line The Death Gate Cycle Time Hearing impairment Ayyavazhi mythology Time Out of Mind The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past Items in the Metroid series Mercury 4 Social rule I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Journey (band) The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases 2005 United States Grand Prix Gnosticism General relativity Rudolf Hermann Lotze Crimson Chin Sex Pistols Paul Is Dead The Dalek Invasion of Earth Evidence of evolution Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Bob and George Gravity The Tick Blood (computer game) The Legend of Zelda series enemies Resurrection of Jesus Saruman Current teachings of Prem Rawat Taxi Driver Time travel Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Volleyball Overkill (band) Grunge music Hiberno-English CPU design Saw II Beatles for Sale Cat coat genetics Wassily Kandinsky Guqin Sin City Aesthetic Realism Appeal 24 Hours of Le Mans Lechaina Moon Modem Drill bit Traffic light Wyatt Earp Tag StarCraft Episode VI TGV Baroque chess Super Mario 64 Past teachings of Prem Rawat W.
