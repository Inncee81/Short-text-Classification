quesiton about limewire and my ipod okay so i know about the whole get it to itunes thing but i heard if you put a corrupt file on there it will wipe the memory is that all it does so i would just have to put in the extra time to fill it back up or does it make the ipod unusable limewire usually tells you if the file is corrupt and asks if you want to remove it or keep downloading it i just delete it and get another version of that song i have never put a corrupt song on mine albeit i have had crappy versions of songs on there that i find and remove and replace but never corrupted songs ITunes IPod ITunes Music Store LimeWire Apple Computer FairPlay Digital audio player IPod nano RealNetworks Warez Online music store Macintosh Finder Digital rights management MGM Studios, Inc. v.
