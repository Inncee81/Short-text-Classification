how do i transfer my music tracks from musicmatch jukebox to yahoo music jukebox okay this isn't specific to those two players but generally there should be an option under the file menu that says something to the affect of load file or load folder if you choose that you can browse to your folder which holds the music for your musicmatch jukebox and open them it should re create the files in the yahoo music jukebox folder then you can just delete the files from the musicmatch folder if that doesn't work you can always do it manually find the musicmatch and yahoo jukebox folders under my computer and manually cut and paste the music files from one folder to the other Windows Explorer SonicStage IPod Mouse (computing) File system System 7 (Macintosh) Windows 2000 Online music store Bluetooth Gracenote System/36 Gmail Object Desktop ILife Digital audio player Dell Digital Jukebox NTFS Mac OS X PlayStation Portable All Media Guide Cue sheet Windows Vista Podcasting MegaMan Battle Network 3 Creative Zen Konqueror Directory Danger Hiptop Apple typography History of the graphical user interface NTFS junction point BZFlag Enterprise content management Virtual memory Mod (computer gaming) Library (computer science) Emacs Path (computing) Launchd Uploading and downloading File Allocation Table Computer virus Disc jockey Common Unix Printing System Mozilla Thunderbird HTTP cookie File folder .NET assemblies System/34 Creative Nomad Mixtape Gramophone record Partition (computing) Web page FairPlay Mac OS history Jukebox Fischer Random Chess Floppy disk Mozilla Firefox AmigaOS Replay Gain Getting Things Done Spatial file manager Macromedia Flash Start Menu Icon (computing) All Music Guide Common User Access Mac OS Screenshot Billboard Hot 100 MSN Messenger Windows registry Domain Name System National Oceanographic Data Center Mac OS X v10.4 P__li Stardock Computer file management Manual transmission XMPlay HTML element World Wide Web Google Btrieve Wipeout (game) Backup Apple Filing Protocol Disk cloning System 6 Resource fork QuickTime ZIP (file format) CPU cache CDDB DVD
