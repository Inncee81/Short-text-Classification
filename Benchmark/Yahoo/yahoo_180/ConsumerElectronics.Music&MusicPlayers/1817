is it possible and relatively easy to hook up my desktop system to my home stereo speakers with all the great internet radio stations wanted to know if this is possible without having to by new expensive systems computers etc thanks in advance to all who answer i will vote on best answer yes it's very easy but it also depends on how far away from your stereo you computer sits the closer the easier it is to connect them you can connect it with a wire that is the cheapest and simplest way but you've got to get a wire from the computer to the home stereo reciever if it sits close this is no biggie but if not you might have to run a wire in the attic and this gets tricky you will need a wire like this if you choose to do it that way you would plug the single cable end into a line out jack on your computer if your computer doesn't have a line out jack then you could use a headphone out but it would be better to use the line out if you have one then plug the dual rca end of the cable into any audio input on your stereo reciever http www radioshack com product index jsp productid cp sr origkw f rca kw f rca parentpage search if you want to do this wirelessly or if you computer is just too far away from your home stereo reciever to practically run a wire you have an option like these http www crutchfield com s ekumlhql ml cgi bin prodgroup asp g any of those on that page will wirelessly get your music on your pc to your stereo reciever the good thing about the second wireless option is they all have remote controls so you don't have to use the computer keyboard and mouse to change songs or pause etc Bluetooth Jack plug IPod Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Universal Serial Bus Internet Modem Television Xbox Common Unix Printing System Atari ST Telegraphy Walkman Wi-Fi IMac Xbox 360 Loudspeaker Synthesizer Mouse (computing) Digital audio workstation Apple Macintosh Laptop Musical Instrument Digital Interface Computer HyperText Transfer Protocol Computer hardware Floppy disk Tungsten Handheld RadioShack Telephone exchange Windows 2000 Apple IIGS Ethernet Power line communication Password Stereoscopy SCART FM broadcasting PlayStation Portable DVD Advanced Technology Attachment TRS connector AirPort Personal computer Nintendo DS Wireless access point Apple Computer Game Boy Desktop computer High fidelity Remote control Mixing console Uniform Resource Locator D-subminiature Digital circuit Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting Amstrad CPC Federal Standard 1037C Embedded system Domain Name System Windows XP RCA Vacuum tube Headphones NBC IBM PC compatible Speech recognition PDP-11 Spark plug HTTP cookie Texas Instruments TI-99/4A Internet protocol suite Wardenclyffe Tower Sinclair ZX81 System/36 Nintendo Opera (web browser) Radio Gramophone record Nintendo Entertainment System Amateur radio Commodore 64 XLR connector X Window System Oscilloscope DIN connector Sound recording Domestic AC power plugs and sockets Multitrack recording Karaoke WiMAX
