i am stuck between the large ipod and the microsoft zune im leaning more toward the zune any suggestions i have had an ipod nano and the center button is stuck and alot of mechanical problems have arisen i have also heard the the zune is to big for pockets is this true yeah the media is madly in love with the ipod as a result they simply like to blow up any competition that arises the zune is sorta pocketable but its much smaller when it is seen and held by the consumer ipods are known to improve greatly with each generation so im sure the mechanical problems are perhaps not as bad just remember that no mp player is completely immune to mechanical problems i own one ipod and it has all i ever needed i owned zunes and i had to take each one back i'm neither a zune or ipod fanboy i just want something reliable that works the problem with the zune was the awful syncing software the pics videos and album art was distorted and fuzzy the battery life was woeful even when i opted to use battery saving features on the device and i only got about hours at the most my advice i'd say to go for the ipod but i'll let you decide since you are curious about the zune buy the zune first and make sure you can take it back easily w o any hassle the zune is a fun device to use but don't let that blind you from reliablility problems that may arise i think ipods are for people who just want things done IPod IPod nano Gramophone record ITunes Apple Computer IPod shuffle IPod mini Creative Zen Digital rights management Floppy disk Walkman Digital audio player ITunes Music Store Windows Mobile Windows XP Pinball USB flash drive Apple Macintosh Computer Digital circuit Game Boy Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Redundant array of independent disks IMac Mouse (computing) Poker jargon Digital photography Handheld game console Macromedia Flash Mac OS X v10.4 Podcasting IBM PC compatible FairPlay Hearing impairment Daylight saving time Copy protection Mach kernel Internal ballistics Wireless Application Protocol Aerial (dance move) Apple Newton Game Boy Advance Nintendo Entertainment System FireWire Sony Nintendo IPod photo U2 (band) Madonna (entertainer) Vorbis Apple typography Linux kernel Hearing aid MiniDisc CPU design Jumpstart 3rd Grade Car handling Sega Palm OS The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie IPAQ Nuclear weapon design X Window System Calculator Bicycle lighting Game Boy Micro Intellivision The Ashlee Simpson Show First-person shooter Pocket PC Nintendo DS Microsoft Windows Console wars Cheating in Counter-Strike Shaggy dog story Second Battle of the Atlantic Mnemonic Battery (electricity) Textile manufacturing Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory Incandescent light bulb High fidelity Embedded system Aerosmith Extreme Programming Liquid crystal display Tank H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Computer and video games True Crime: Streets of LA Modem Betting (poker) Laptop Theory of conduct Emotions (album) Disc jockey
