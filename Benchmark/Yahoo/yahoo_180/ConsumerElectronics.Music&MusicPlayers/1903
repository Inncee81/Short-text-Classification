how do you use a windows formatted ipod on a mac i just got a new macbook and i want to put some of the music from the mac onto my ipod so there is two problems how do i prevent all the music on the ipod from being deleted i cant find the menu that lets you switch it to manual and the other problem is do i have to reformat the ipod for it to work on my mac you used to be able to sync a pc formatted ipod with a mac but apple basically changed that ability with some of their recent upgrades toitunes the only way i've been able to do it was to keep the ipod itself at pc version but without upgrading the ipod you're not going to be able to sync it with the current version of itunes bottom line if you plan on keeping the ipod synced to your macbook then yes you're probably going to reformat it if that's problem then i'd suggest you keep it synced to your pc IPod ITunes ITunes Music Store Apple Macintosh Apple Computer Mac OS X v10.4 IPod nano Podcasting Digital rights management Walkman Macintosh Finder IPhoto IPod mini Mac OS X IPod shuffle ILife QuickTime Online music store WordPerfect Vorbis IMac Apple typography Digital audio player NeXT Gmail FairPlay H.264/MPEG-4 AVC AppleScript Microsoft Windows IPod photo Floppy disk Mac mini Object Desktop Creative Zen Microsoft Office X Window System Mouse (computing) Mac OS 8 RealNetworks Internet Explorer for Mac Unicode Apple II family Mozilla Firefox Daylight saving time Mac OS X v10.3 HyperCard Hard disk Steve Jobs OpenOffice.org Visual Basic Advanced Audio Coding MacWrite History of the graphical user interface Mac OS history Emacs SonicStage Swingout PowerPC Apple Newton Option key Chicago (typeface) Pretty Good Privacy Mac OS Windows 2000 Mozilla Application Suite PlayStation Portable Screenshot Linux kernel History of Microsoft Windows MSN Messenger Opera (web browser) C programming language File Allocation Table Java programming language Wipeout (game) Mac rumors community U2 (band) Atari ST Original Amiga chipset MP3 Apple Intel transition Copy protection Internet Relay Chat Rhapsody (online music service) Ethernet Optimized Systems Software WordStar HFS Plus DragonFly BSD PowerBook Apple Store Aqua (GUI) Windows Media Player Gramophone record Copland QuarkXPress
