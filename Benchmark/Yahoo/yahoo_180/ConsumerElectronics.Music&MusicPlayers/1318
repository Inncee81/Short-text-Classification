does the apple store let you exchange an old ipod i have the old ipod nano and i want an ipod video does anyone know if the apple store pays you if you give them your old ipod and if so how much apple does have a recycling program which keeps tech waste out of the environment a very good idea if your ipod isn't working anymore please look into it they don't give you any money back or discounts for this though unless you're an educational or business customer and you qualify for a trade in call the store if you think you might otherwise it's simply a free service to help the environment if your ipod is still in good shape and working i'd suggest selling it on amazon or ebay and using the money from that as your trade in or discount Apple Computer ITunes Music Store ITunes IPod IPod nano IPod shuffle Retailer IPod mini Electronic commerce Podcasting Amazon.com Trademark Napster (pay service) Wal-Mart Steve Jobs Bond RealNetworks Mutual fund Dot-com First-sale doctrine Apple typography Apple Macintosh Economics Online music store Digital rights management Gramophone record FireWire Apple Newton IPod photo IMac Inflation Apple II family FairPlay Money MP3 Gift economy Gross domestic product Stock Price discrimination ILife Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution Apple Store Creative Zen Management information system Sears Holdings Corporation Revco Capital accumulation Gold standard London Congestion Charge Madonna (entertainer) Law of value Microeconomics Disc jockey QuickTime Auction NeXT Department store Economy of the United States Bulk vending Mac OS X Hewlett-Packard H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Microsoft Intellectual property Fiat money Computer virus U2 (band) Corporate finance Walkman Political economy Supermarket Filling station Commodore 64 Arbitrage Bumiputra Network effect Commodity markets Business-to-consumer electronic commerce Copyleft USB flash drive Digital audio player Recycling Closed-end fund Wireless Application Protocol Matrix scheme Fractional-reserve banking Mac OS X v10.4 Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Aldi FairTax Timeline of computing 1990-forward Logo Mac rumors community Financial services Textbook Anarchism and capitalism Waste management Loss leader Neopets Octopus card
