how can i increase the memory of my ipod video with out changing the memory card my friend claims he can increase his ipod video from to gig without changing the memory card first of all there is no memory card in the video ipods it uses an internal hard drive by memory card you are implying that the ipod video uses flash memory which it doesn't there is absolutely no way to increase the gb to a gb without having to open up the ipod and replace the hard drive for the higher capacity one even if you can hack the internal hd so that it belives it is of a higher capacity i haven't seen a lot of that going around and the most you could probably get is a kb increase in space therefore your comrade lies disappointing i know but its the truth IPod USB flash drive IPod shuffle Apple Computer Flash memory ITunes Digital audio player Redundant array of independent disks Floppy disk IPod nano IMac Apple Macintosh Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories Mac mini IPod mini Microdrive Secure Digital card Creative Zen PlayStation 3 Digital photography Computer storage Computer bus IBM PC FireWire Walkman Apple II family CompactFlash Xbox Gramophone record Modchip Memory card IPod photo Xserve Binary prefix Sega Dreamcast Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Memory Stick TRS-80 MRAM Hard disk Personal computer File Allocation Table Podcasting Vorbis Archos Computer and video games Game Boy Advance Apple IIGS Nintendo DS MiniDisc ITunes Music Store Blackjack Neopets Texas Instruments TI-99/4A PowerBook Linux kernel The Sims 2 Nintendo 64 Dynamic random access memory K' Tungsten Handheld IBM PC compatible Nintendo Revolution PC card Resident Evil (video game) Digital rights management Computer hardware The Sims 2: University Commodore 64 Radeon BIOS PlayStation 2 Video game music Sound Blaster Computer Yu-Gi-Oh!
