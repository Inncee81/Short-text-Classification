ready to become a dj well i think i am ready to become a dj because to listen to the music day and night i feel that i have the music in me because there is something in the music that makes me feel alive and now i used a home stereo i connected to my computer and i have a software called virtual dj and i also have a mixmeister that i make my own cd and remix and in party's i am always in charge with the music and everytime i play some song and my own mixes i always have everybody dancing and everybody says that i should have my own dj system and make my own little bussnes but i have a question when i start and make my own bussnes cards should i created my own dj name and how much time do i need to become a club dj or a professional dj because i have a feeling that i can go far if i whant too because i have resived letters to go too a school that is in bevery hills but the thing is that i don't have a high school diploma or a ged a dj name is pretty important it is what identifies you and gives people a name to tell others best bet would be to think long and hard about your name look up your ideas because there are tens of thousands of dj's who think they will make it big and the chances of your cool dj name being taken already are pretty good but don't think you have to be dj insert cheese here the biggest dj's in the industry now are also producers they actually create the songs they spin and most don't have the title dj in their names paul van dyk armin van buuren ferry corsten carl cox even dj tiesto prefers to be called tiesto these days but club dj's who aren't producers simply dj's still attach the title of dj to their names being a club dj is as much a science as an artform you have to understand people and be able to read the crowd you have to be spot on with your mixes or the train wrecks will kill the crowd and if the dj kills the crowd the club owner never invites them back practice your mixes get some tables and a mixer and some vinyl mixing in a program is easy most club dj's today will use programs and pro cd players but only to supplement their turntable skills practice practice practice then submit tapes to clubs they may ask you to try out if you're good but keep in mind what soulwax said everybody wants to be a dj Armin van Buuren Disc jockey Ferry Corsten Trance music Tijs Verwest The Chemical Brothers Multitrack recording GED Hip hop culture Gramophone record The Beatles discography House music Mixtape Paul van Dyk We Belong Together Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Above & Beyond Betting (poker) Time Out of Mind Beatmania IIDX Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival The Emancipation of Mimi Beatmatching Theory of conduct Bastard pop Timpani Adult contemporary music The Beatles bootlegs Jennifer Lopez Poker jargon Pet Sounds Roxette Computer Minor league baseball Extreme Championship Wrestling Wipeout (game) The Beach Boys Ron and Fez Sampling (music) Social rule Oasis (band) Floppy disk Debugging Homeschooling Music radio Bouncy techno Norway national football team Phonograph The Basement Tapes The Rutles Digital audio workstation I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue Redundant array of independent disks Contract bridge CPU design Janet Jackson Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of The Beach Boys Objective-C Computer virus Dance Dance Revolution Pretty Good Privacy Audiophile The Pet Sounds Sessions Seventh Sea (collectible card game) Education in Portugal Database The Cure The Ashlee Simpson Show Sydney Riot of 1879 Killing Joke Unreleased Madonna songs Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Lindy Hop Shania Twain DDRMAX: Dance Dance Revolution 6thMIX Jon Secada American Pie (song) AmigaOS Peter Gabriel Rave music Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMIX It's Like That (Mariah Carey song) Yoko Ono MP3 Textile manufacturing American Psycho
