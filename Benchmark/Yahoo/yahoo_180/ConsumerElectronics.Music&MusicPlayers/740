mp compresser hi i wanted know if their is an mp compressing software to compress mp so they can fit on my cell beacause i have only megs of space if you got the files which is only mp i suggest a mp converter such as freemp wma converter download it at download comthe thing you need to do is change the birate or if the converter got a preset value choose phone or fm radio they'll give you pretty low size as kbs in this case if you use freemp wmaconverter you choose the format parameter then choose preset i suggest you try to convert to phone quality first and dont delete the original filefirst then test listening them if they sucks try to convert to fm instead i think you dont have a problem sending your mp s into your phone anyway MP3 Vorbis Audio data compression ITunes Musical Instrument Digital Interface Podcasting Advanced Audio Coding Modem JPEG Bluetooth ITunes Music Store PNG Digital photography GIF Enterprise content management Gmail Audio file format NTFS Audiophile WAV Streaming media Digital audio player Web crawler PlayStation Portable Online music store JPEG 2000 Java programming language Windows Media Audio SonicStage Verizon Wireless File sharing Jet engine Skype Wood Trusted computing Speex DVD Telephone Floppy disk ZIP (file format) Linux Bulletin board system Cellular network Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting FidoNet Xbox Digital rights management Movie projector H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Carbon dioxide Fuel cell Data compression Warez Lossy data compression Nintendo N-Gage Telephone tapping Morse Code Voice over IP Coding theory Walkman Library (computer science) Malware Computer virus Opera (web browser) Speech synthesis Mobile phone Halo 2 Portable Document Format Video codec Audio mastering Anonymous remailer File Transfer Protocol File format Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Mozilla Firefox Raw image format MDAC Radio Pretty Good Privacy File system Common Unix Printing System Backup Base Station Subsystem Geographic information system File Allocation Table Hydrogen economy BlackBerry Forth programming language Game programmer StuffIt MiniDisc Hardware random number generator Video Wireless Application Protocol Creative Zen Filename extension UTF-8 Image file formats
