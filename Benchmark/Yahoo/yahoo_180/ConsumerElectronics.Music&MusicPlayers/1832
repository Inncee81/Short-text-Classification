considering a creative zen v plus gb i am shopping around for an mp player i'd like one that does photos but i don't know if i really care about video capabilities i would like to be able to use some sort of docking station though for traveling in hotel rooms so i've been considering this zen v i'm just not sold on the whole ipod thing does what are the pros and cons of this player other than the gotta have windows xp thing what do you specifically like or dislike about this player would you recommend something else where is the best place to buy one i don't have a whole lot of shopping to choose from where i live walmart fred meyer best buy are maybe the best choices or it is possible to buy online but then the shipping kills me here in alaska points to the most complete answer either pro or con i bought this about months ago and so far it has performed flawlessly i wanted at all costs to avoid the ipod i like the fact that it has gb compared to my previous creative gb player this one also does videos though you have to use the included video converter i wouldn't recommend watching movies on it as the screen is small however overall compared to the same size nano this is a better player they also have regular creative zen v gb without the video feature for about less the small size is great it is shorter but thicker than the nano but fits inside thatlittle levi's jeans change pocket i needed a flash player that i could exercise with and this one fit the bill this player syncs well with zencast and i was able to get all of my podcasts it will also sync with itunes through windows media player butusing zencast directly is much simpler though zencast is not as intuitive as itunes you should be able to figure it out you can do some neat things like listening to music while looking at your photos included in the package is a lanyard software connecting cable ear buds the battery recharges only hooked up to the usb port on your computer or with an optional charger battery life is not great you are supposed to get hours for music but i haven't gotten that though i have been fiddlingwith it a lot using the back light the player has a built in fm tuner though you can't record the radio on it as you can on other creative players there is also a microphone recorder so you can easily record meetings and the like i bought a case for it so that i can run with it but the screen and the unit are made of good grade plastic and it doesn't scratch easily i would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice looking cute even mp player for exercising and listening while commuting one problem to take note of is that since this is not a ipod accessories are going to be hard to find and probably of lesser quality they sell the creative player at walmart online and you can have the player and its accessories shipped but if you were to walk into the store to buy the player you aren't going to find any accessories to go with it hope this helps IPod shuffle USB flash drive PlayStation Portable Podcasting Apple Macintosh ITunes Music Store Digital audio player Xbox 360 Nintendo DS Digital photography IMac Windows XP Floppy disk Nintendo MP3 Mouse (computing) IPod mini IPod photo Game Boy Advance IBM PC compatible Handheld game console Online music store QuickTime Vorbis Gramophone record Xbox PlayStation 2 Tungsten Handheld Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Laptop Creative Nomad Digital rights management Universal Serial Bus Nintendo Revolution Copy protection Karaoke Sega Atari 8-bit family Atari ST PC Engine Laserdisc Commodore 64 Game Boy Video game music NeXT Airsoft DVD Apple Newton FireWire Surveillance Dance Dance Revolution AmigaOS IPAQ Theory of conduct MapleStory PlayStation 3 Game Boy Micro We Belong Together Sega Dreamcast Energy development Musical Instrument Digital Interface PNG Wal-Mart Sound card Humphrey Bogart TurboGrafx 16 Mac OS X v10.4 The Emancipation of Mimi Hearing aid Lego Mac OS X Apple typography Disc jockey Nintendo Entertainment System Redundant array of independent disks ILife MiniDisc Television U2 (band) Cable television Cascading Style Sheets Audiophile Sega Saturn
