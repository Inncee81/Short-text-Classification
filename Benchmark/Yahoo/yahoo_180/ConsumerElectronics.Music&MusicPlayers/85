ipod question hi i have a gb ipod nano and i and think about upgrading to an ipod video now heres the question is there a way you give your ipod back to apple and then pay like the extra for the video or no i no a good amount about the ipods but wasnt sure on that so if you know let me know thanks no the only way you can really even return your ipod is if you have the warranty paper and even then i think they'd only let you if it breaks Apple Computer IPod ITunes ITunes Music Store IPod nano IPod mini Mac mini IPod shuffle Creative Zen H.264/MPEG-4 AVC FireWire Vorbis Warranty IPod photo FairPlay IMac Digital audio player Gramophone record Podcasting Apple Macintosh Steve Jobs Digital rights management Madonna (entertainer) The End of the World (Doctor Who) Walkman Disc jockey Mac OS X v10.4 Redundant array of independent disks Star Wars kid High fidelity Handheld video game IPhoto Mac rumors community Floppy disk Loss leader ILife IBook Versions and ports of Doom Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Apple Store U2 (band) QuickTime Napster (pay service) Linux kernel Apple Newton RealNetworks USB flash drive Online music store Advanced Audio Coding Headphones Chicago (typeface) Vlog MP3 Atari 8-bit family Logo Touchpad Jonathan Ive Daft Punk GP2X Ocean's Twelve Pinball RealPlayer Archos Broadcom Apple typography Fiona Apple Seal (musician) Game Boy Advance Money Creative Nomad Feel Good Inc.
