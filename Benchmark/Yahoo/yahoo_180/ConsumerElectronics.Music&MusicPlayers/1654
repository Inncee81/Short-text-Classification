can i burn wma on a cd r and still play it in the car or i have to stick to the mp s you can record wma on a cdr the ability to play files that are not wave depends on the deck in your car not knowing the brand model of the deck you have in your car i can only say that it will only play mp files i'm not sure for that being said what kind of cdrs are you using it is attactive to purchase cheap cdrs and dvdr rws the problem with doing this is that you run into discs that are so cheaply made that they error on a regular basis as i have statoed in previous posting the only cds and dvds i will use are in order sony fuji and tdk a good indication as to the quatity of a disc is the richness of color let us take cdrs for an example they are all blue ish for the most part i worked for circuit city since i've seen the intro of cdr and dvdr umong others the things i've learned from my career path amung other is that the darker a disc is usually means the better the quality although i have not looked to far into it i believe that the reason for this is that it had more dye more dye means that it has more resourses to retain the info stored on it i intentionally spend more on the discs that i buy because of this i have had little to no errors occur during recording or playback just remember you get what you pay for is a hyunda may be a good car but would you compare it to a rolls royce or even a bmw no i love a good value but i also love quality finding a blance can be hard thank goodness we have the internet CD-R MP3 DVD PlayStation 2 Laserdisc Compact disc ITunes Music Store IPod Compact audio cassette PlayStation Portable Copy protection Digital photography Digital rights management Floppy disk High-definition television Amstrad CPC Video game music Lisp programming language Audiophile Super Nintendo Entertainment System Poker jargon Vorbis BMW Videocassette recorder Phonograph H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Blu-ray Disc High fidelity Sound recording Sega Dreamcast DV Computer Audio file format MAME VHS PlayStation 3 Cassette deck Gran Turismo (game) Video codec Inflation Bulk vending Online music store Joy Division (band) Atari 8-bit family Common Lisp Carburetor Microeconomics Steam (content delivery) Creative Zen Rolls-Royce Television Time Out of Mind Computer virus Sega Saturn Modchip Extreme Programming Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind The Beatles discography WAV Mac OS X Pok__mon Chronicles Nintendo Revolution MDAC Disc brake Technicolor Ripping USB flash drive Oasis (band) Video CD Final Fantasy IX Motorcycle TiVo Second language acquisition Gross domestic product Disk image Phonograph cylinder Knoppix Causality Yohoho!
