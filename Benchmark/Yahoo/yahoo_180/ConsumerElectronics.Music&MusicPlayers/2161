what keyboard should i get i've played the piano on and off by ear since i was probably i am currently borrowing my uncle's keyboard and have been for quite a while it's about time i get my own i was considering the yamaha ypg at around was gonna be my limit but then i saw the ypg for and i can't decide should i get the ypg or wait it out and save for the ypg or is there something better that someone could offer also i have never purchased an instrument online and am wary of some sites could you provide a link to a great shop online and is there any differences between the ypg and the dgx thanks in advance that's a lot of questions i am not familiar with any of the instruments that you have posted though i have bought a reasonable amount of keyboards and music gear over the years there are some guidelines in choosing a new instrument first thing you need to do is get a list of specs of each keyboard and compare them side by side to help you decie what's important put a check on the features that you require on the list hammer weighted action usb compatibility keys weight pitchbend polypony etc and cross out the features that dont matter the major influencing factor of purchasing anything is of course your budget look at the list again will you be really needing that extra feature on that newest model or will you be able to live without it if it's that important then go and pay for that extra if not then just settle for the lesser model and save yourself some money don't buy gear just because it's the newest release the disadvantage of buying the new ones is that you will pay the initial release price which is usually high and there's also the risk of the product being rushed to the market too early which may have some bugs or defects that have not been properly checked as much as possible i'd advise you to buy on a music store instead you can check out the product's quality first hand i hope that helps Floppy disk Insurance Betting (poker) Atari ST Piano Poker jargon Publicly funded medicine Gross domestic product Atari 8-bit family Musical Instrument Digital Interface Supply and demand Video game music Information Services Procurement Library Synthesizer IPod Laserdisc Microeconomics Universal Serial Bus Mouse (computing) PlayStation 2 Capitalism Digital photography IMac Inflation DVD IBM PC compatible CPU cache Windows Vista Apple Macintosh Airsoft Keynesian economics Electronic commerce Hard disk Mutual fund The Amazing Race Free trade Money Electronic organ Animal Crossing Apple Computer Finance Bank Intellivision Internet fraud Sega Dreamcast Sound Blaster Tesco Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Cheating in Counter-Strike Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Oscilloscope Mattress Monetary policy Final Fantasy XI Philatelic investment Annuity Commodore International Mac OS X MapleStory Overclocking Surveillance Bretton Woods system System/36 Microsoft Prostate cancer Model (economics) Password American individualist anarchism ITunes Herbie Hancock PlayStation 3 Game programming Bond Corporate finance PE ratio Growth hormone treatment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Health insurance History of the United States (1918-1945) Amstrad CPC Open Directory Project Monopsony Hyperinflation Douglas DC-8 Timeline of computing 1990-forward Radeon Craps
