which portable media player should i get mp mp etc currently i am deciding between samsung nv it's got a camera too cowon d really slick zvue really cheap i'm also open to any other suggestions but i believe i'll end up choosing one of these in the end thanks have you thought about a zune it's not that much more expensive than these other products you are considering it does mp and wmv video playback mp and wma sound fm tuner wi fi it can store pictures and has a built in gb hard drive microsoft has excellent support system for it with a no hassles warranty policy and it can also play back video on your tv just like the cowon d with these other devices you are limited to the size of the sd card you are using gigs sd card only holds about cd quality songs in addition to it the nv is a camera with audio playback capability which means it will drain the battery very quickly my friend has a cowon and he says it is also a battery hog however he does like it a lot if you are very insistent on only these three models i would go with the cowon d however you should strongly consider the zune it does everything you want and is more likely to be the standard in portable media player within the next years Digital audio player ITunes Vorbis Creative Zen IPod Archos High-definition television Digital photography Cowon Windows XP Television PlayStation Portable MP3 Handheld game console Iriver Laserdisc Walkman MiniDisc Camcorder Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis DVD Digital camera Xbox Compact disc Computer Compact audio cassette Apple Computer Videocassette recorder Nintendo 64 PlayStation 3 Universal Serial Bus Sound card Hard disk Sony VHS Atari 8-bit family Windows Mobile Digital cinematography Karaoke IBM PC compatible Gramophone record Musical Instrument Digital Interface Digital rights management TurboGrafx 16 QuickTime Streaming media Laptop Amstrad CPC Audiophile PlayStation 2 USB flash drive High fidelity Video codec Windows Media Audio Sharp Zaurus ATI Technologies Copy protection Video game music Sound recording Phonograph Flash memory IPAQ Windows Media Player Floppy disk Disc jockey Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting IBook TiVo History of computer and video games USB mass storage device class Windows Media Video Sega Dreamcast Sound Blaster Digital video recorder Personal computer Bicycle lighting Game programming Redundant array of independent disks H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Mac OS X File Allocation Table Surveillance Machinima Tungsten Handheld Game Boy Advance PowerBook
