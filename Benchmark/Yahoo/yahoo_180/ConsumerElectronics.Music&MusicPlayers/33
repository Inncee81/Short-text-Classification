martin acoustic guitar my grandfather has a martin acoustic guitar based on the serial number it was made in it is in excellent condition and has very few scratches how much would an instrument like this be worth orion blue book circa about bucks but i'd say way more than that for the right buyer it's considered prewar and those are skyrocketing in value currently don't sell it if you can and keep it in a humidity controlled environment it's illegal to make guitars the way that one was made now so it won't go bad unless you are bad to it i'd insure it asap if you have to sell post on my blog below and i'll make sure you aren't ripped off can't buy myself Guitar R.E.M.
