returning an ipod at costco i bought a gig ipod photo over years ago at costco and am thinking about returning it when the new generation comes out i bought it there specifically for the return policy and now i am seeing that they have changed their return policy on electronics to days only since i bought my ipod before the policy changed would i still be able to return it or would i be subject to the change which occurred after i purchased the product the policy for the product is the one that was active when you bought the thing its like you bought the ipod from me as an example and i said i would return it if you want to and this deal lasts years but after you bought it i'm like i changed my mind you cant return it but if you bought it after the policy changed and you knew that the policy lasts only days then they dont have to return it Costco IPod Digital rights management ITunes Music Store Apple Computer Economics Wal-Mart Political economy IPod shuffle Life insurance Billboard Hot 100 Insurance Intellectual property Supply and demand Surveillance Trade Microeconomics Mutual fund Gross domestic product FairPlay IPod mini IPod photo Apple Macintosh Creative Zen Publishing IPod nano Ethical consumerism Fry's Electronics Monetary policy Boycott Scientology beliefs and practices Best Buy Annuity Electronic Arts Steve Jobs ITunes Inflation Hearing impairment Infantilism Gramophone record Public policy Blog Contract Trademark United Kingdom corporation tax ILife Linux kernel Commodity Estoppel Famine The Chemical Brothers Surrender of Japan Islamic banking Say's law Psychoanalysis Day trading Digital photography FireWire Milton H.
