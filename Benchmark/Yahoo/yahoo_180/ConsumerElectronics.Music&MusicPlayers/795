do you think we'll get back my sons stolen ipod he was laying on a foot high retaining wall after school listening to his ipod three guys came by and stole it off his chest he reported it to the school and police and we also supplied the serial number just in case it's found they even have a recording of the guys running away it was locked with a password is there a way they could unlock it and use it or would they have just thrown it away is there anything else i should do you probably won't get it back and unfortunately if they put it in a computer they may be able to use it because ususually if you reset an ipod and put it in a computer the lock code has been cleared it may delete the songs on it but they can still use it Password Apple Computer IPod nano IPod Apple Macintosh USB flash drive Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ITunes Music Store Episodes of Lost (Season 2) IPod mini Read-copy-update Digital rights management Podcasting Columbine High School massacre HP BASIC for OpenVMS Professional wrestling holds IPod shuffle Advanced Audio Coding Key (lock) Ocean's Twelve System/34 FairPlay Professional wrestling double-team maneuvers Walkman Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Disc jockey Professional wrestling attacks IMac Aerial (dance move) Rugby union positions System/36 World War Three (Doctor Who) Windows XP Super Mario Kart 11001001 (TNG episode) Doctor Who (Enemy Within) RealNetworks The End of the World (Doctor Who) Redundant array of independent disks Dennis Rader High fidelity FireWire Lindy Basic Mac mini Modchip Suplex IPod photo Frontier in Space Perfect Dark Control-Alt-Delete Reservoir Dogs Computer security Pirate decryption 2004 U.S. presidential election controversy, voting machines Embedded system Professional wrestling throws H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Ecco the Dolphin Malware Napster (pay service) Rugby union Trusted computing Jumpstart 3rd Grade Gramophone record Steve Jobs Kindaichi Case Files Digital audio player Sin City Apple Newton EIA-708 Internet fraud RFID Compact audio cassette Windows 2000 Eddie Guerrero Objective-C Library (computer science) Star Wars kid Linked list Time Out of Mind Sega Mega Drive/Sega Genesis Stopping e-mail abuse The Daleks' Master Plan Recoil operation RuneScape cheats GoldenEye 007 TimeSplitters: Future Perfect Johnny 5 Marching band ALGOL 68 Hacker (computer security) Blood Simple Commodore 128 Microsoft Windows History of Microsoft Windows Stolen base Animal Crossing The Curse of Fenric Sonic the Hedgehog 2
