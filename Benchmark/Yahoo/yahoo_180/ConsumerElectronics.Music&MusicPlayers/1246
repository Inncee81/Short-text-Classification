why do u think cd's arent selling as much i think bootleg illegal downloads and alot of them suck ya i agree for one people aren't into music like they used to be i guess they don't appreciate it as much anymore a lot of music they listen to is on tv on their video games or on youtube another reason might be that everyone is litening watching online or downloading them illegally and also they might be buying it from itunes or other places rather than the whole cd hmm thats a rlly good question ITunes Music Store ITunes Warez Video game music Online music store Mixtape Pearl Jam Theory of conduct Copyright infringement of software MAME Napster (pay service) We Belong Together MP3 Apple Computer Abandonware ROM image Jon Lech Johansen The Beatles bootlegs Podcasting Nintendo This Week in Tech Dave Matthews Band Napster Sampling (music) UK Singles Chart Digital rights management Ultima Online Copy protection Computer and video games Steam (content delivery) Extraordinary Machine Guns N' Roses Boards of Canada You Don't Know Jack Minesweeper (computer game) IPod Avril Lavigne Diablo II: Lord of Destruction Confidence trick Speech synthesis Motion picture rating system Read-only memory Bastard pop Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism America's Army PlayStation 3 Journey (band) Bootleg recording Nintendo Revolution Shake It Off Billboard Hot 100 The Beatles discography Rich Mullins Shakira Russian joke MTV Black Eyed Peas Vanilla Ninja Delta Goodrem ILife Copyright infringement Vorbis Baroque chess Pirate radio Xbox RealNetworks Wheel of Fortune Internet fraud GamePark Crazy in Love Joy Division (band) Coldplay Gold Digger Rhapsody (online music service) The Star Wars Holiday Special FairPlay Halo 2 Buddy Guy Arular Black market Peter Gabriel Star Trek, other storylines Euphemism Jennifer Lopez Xbox Live Loss leader Billboard magazine Xenosaga Digital download Fort Minor Hung Up (song) File sharing Self Portrait Paintball Warren Cuccurullo Manga Neopets
