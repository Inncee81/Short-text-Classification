how long is too long with video games my year old son loves to play video games but i am really torn up with how long is too long my husband and i don't agree all the time when he has been on for what i think is too long he is pretty active outside and does go out everyday and play in the backyard but i have had issues at times when he would rather play the games then go out and argue with me about turning it off for awhile the games he plays are at his level and none of them are violent what do you think minutes a day max your child is not getting anything out of playing those games they are a waste of life time games should be active and be interactive with other people not staring at a television screen children these days are losing their imaginations and tune out when not stimulated in the same manner as video games like at school i think to keep a healthy balance have your son earn video game time and keep it to one or two days a week minutes a piece it just isn't worth it p s do you interact with your son too i'm sure he loves playing and doing things with you o Theory of conduct Computer role-playing game Video game controversy Jon Secada Dance Dance Revolution EXTREME Computer and video games Console game Babylon 5 Meta-reference Drama Anger management Norway national football team EastEnders Shaggy dog story Dorama The Sims GoldenEye 007 BS Zelda: Kodai no Sekiban $ale of the Century Game development Asperger syndrome Goodness and value theory Game show Surveillance Super Mario Bros.
