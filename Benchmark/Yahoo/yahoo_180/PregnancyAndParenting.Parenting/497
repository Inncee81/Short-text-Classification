to older parents who have adult age children what makes having children worth it my husband and i have a great loving stable marriage and look forward to having children some day soon we both come from loving families where we had good childhoods and our parents are still married and love each other i've always been very good with children and i can tell my husband will be an incredible father of the time i can't wait to have children i get so excited and sappy thinking of it but there is of me that dreads some of the changes married couples go through when they have a child you hear horror stories of couples who become so focused on their children that they completely lose sight of each other their r'ship suffers and years later they look up and don't even know each other they have nothing to talk about other than their kids i fear that and my husband knows that he knows it's important to me that if when we have children we continue to build a strong r'ship and not lose sight of our love for each other the other thing i dread or fear is the teenage years that of the time i start thinking is all the good memories you make between ages birth thru age worth having your child practically hate you from age i know not all teenagers hate their parents but it sure seems like it i'm not sure i have it in me to work my butt off for this kid to only have them yell i hate you as they slam the door because you wouldn't buy them a cell phone so i guess my question is is having children worth some of the bad parts you have to endure both to your emotional state and your marriage i know children are a gift and i can imagine there are sooooo many wonderful incredible moments i think it's just fear of the unknown i loooove children and really am excited to become a mother but these issues flitter in the back of my mind you and your husband will have no problems raising your children as you already know what to look for and will work at keeping your marriage strong you sound like people who are perfect for being parents mature responsible thoughtful we raised our two daughters who are now and with two each of their own the rewards come every day when you get a big hug when you watch them sleeping when they giggle take their first steps go to school that first day make new friends kiss your cheek and say i love you but especially when out on their own they make it work because they have been raised by loving mature thoughtful parents like you parenting is perseverance especially when you have teenagers you just keep them close know who they are with stay in touch with their friends' parents and help them make good decisions when they fall you pick them up dust them off give them a lecture take them under your wing and start over again i would do it all over again just the same to have the two loving daughters i have today and my four rambunctious precious grandchildren The Fairly OddParents EastEnders Shaggy dog story About a Boy Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Codename: Kids Next Door Knots Landing Child sexuality Miss Saigon Father's Day (Doctor Who) Piccolo Junior Saga Friends Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Avenue Q Divorce Good Times Charmed Humphrey Bogart We'll Always Have Paris (TNG episode) Jon Secada Ephesian Tale Infantilism John the Baptist Kodocha Saved by the Bell Sigmund Freud Marriage The Amber Spyglass Little Britain Neighbours The Death Gate Cycle Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban The Lovely Bones Sin City Calvin and Hobbes Autism Hollyoaks Dawson's Creek Motion picture rating system Pitaten Haven (TNG episode) Kender Darth Vader Days of our Lives The Shining (film) Incest Futurama (TV series - season 5) Main characters of Fullmetal Alchemist Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Yoko Ono Transactional analysis The Invisibles Juliana of the Netherlands Kurt Cobain Series finale The Human Stain W.I.T.C.H.
