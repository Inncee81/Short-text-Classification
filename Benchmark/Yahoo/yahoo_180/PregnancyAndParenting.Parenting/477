am i being fair so i have two daughters the ages and and sometimes they talk back or disobey me or my husband so we have to punish them for about a year now whenever they do that i take away the year olds cool clothes which are abercrombie and hollister clothes and i take away my year olds makeup both of them say that its totally unfair and that they need those things i feel that neither of them need those things to get by each day the year old has tons of clothes just from different stores like old navy gap macy's target pac sun and limited too so its not like she literally has nothing to where and the year old has perfect skin and has no reason to wear makeup foundation and personally i think shes to young to wear mascara eyeliner and eyeshadow but i let her so the question is am i being fair or should i think of different punishments if you disagree please give me other suggestions thank you so much thank you so much to everyone now i dont feel so bad about taking away their clothes the reason why i chose clothes instead of cell phones computer privileges or tv is because they can get by without them i want my kids to realize that they are blessed to be able to have nice things so i guess its working thank you again it is good to take away your kids privileges and or possessions for punishment i never thought to take away their cool clothes or makeup that's a great idea when my kids disobeyed no phone or tv for the day when my daughter snuck out and i caught her coming back in thru her bedroom window at in the morning i grounded her to her room but i took it a step further and made her put all her electronics outside her room i thought what good is that to sit in her room and watch tv talk on the phone listen to her stereo play video games etc i made her keep her door open and no sleeping she was so tired from being out all night she was mad and yelled what am i suppose to do i told her read a book when my kids were older and got their drivers license and cars for punishment i would take their car away for the weekend the best punishment for kids is to take away what they love most yes it's fair you're doing a great job The Inside Avenue Q Silent Night, Deadly Night Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Sin City Social rule About a Boy Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Oh My Goddess!
