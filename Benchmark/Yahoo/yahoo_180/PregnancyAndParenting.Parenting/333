do you believe this is true about kids many people tell me that i shouldn't get on a kid's level joke around with them because they'll think i'm their age not have any resepct for me when it's time for me to discipline them they also say i shouldn't treat kids nice like buying them snacks giving the money because they'll keep expecting it then the day i tell them no they're gonna start hating me not respecting me other kids' parents tell me that their kids have every right to disrespect me treat me like they have authority over me because i should've never done anything nice for the kids in the first place are they telling me right or wrong are you supposed to be serious with a kid not have any humor that's pretty boring my sisters tell me about how my nieces nephews have a right to disrespect me for wanting to spend time with them but other people tell me that i must joke around with kids do kiddie activities with them to help their learning growing i'm very confused on this subject you should do whatever it is that you want to do if these kids disrespect you put them in their place and move on if you respect them they will respect you kids are all about fun they need discipline but not let them loose and have fun and just be there to laugh with them and make sure they are safe Theory of conduct Avenue Q Milton H.
