what would you do if your child was cursing outside my hubby went looking for our kids the other night to his shock one was cursing then it all went bad from there we found out that my yr old my yr old and my yr old has been doing it well of course they're all grounded now have a sit down talk with them and tell them it's not polite to use those kinds of words and find a pg explanation of why it's not polite and that if they use those words again they'll be punished i'll leave it to you how to best punish your kids also ask them who they learned it from if it's another adult confront the adult and tell them to watch their language around your kids if it's another kid then talk to the parents of that particular kid lay down the law and tell your kids it's wrong but don't be too worried about it yourself it is probably just a phase they are going through i remember one solid year where i thought swearing was cool and used a swear for every other word Miss Saigon Theory of conduct God Emperor of Dune The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Punishment Social rule Futurama (TV series - season 5) Profanity Silent Night, Deadly Night Kain (Legacy of Kain) Humphrey Bogart About a Boy Milton H.
