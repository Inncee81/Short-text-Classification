sibling or parent rivalry i have children from a previous marriage and my wife has from a prior relationship whenever punishment is dealt by her to my kids i will stand behind her but when i punish her son then i am picking on him her son and my oldest daughter are the same age she seems to get more of the punishment than him when a conflict happens between them i understand that as parents we want to protect our kids but i need some help because this is causing to many fights with her and i my husband has children that live with us due to the situation i decided not to have any kids all three of the kids view me as their birth mother i have explained the situation to them as best as possible and left it alone my husband shows severe favoritism to his youngest child which happens to be his only boy the older girls are starting to see that he gets away with alot more and they are starting to distance themselves from their father and cling to me the way i handle these actions from my husband are not easy firstly you need to talk to her let her know that you feel she is very leniant on her child and not yours if she doesn't understand what point you are trying to get across tell her that if your kids do something wrong than you would like to punish them and not her if she doesn't agree with that option than you need to let her know how upset this makes you and your kids when push comes to shove and she doesn't want to compromise i would leave because nothing will ever be as important as your children she needs to know that no matter how much you love her it is not enough to let her mistreat your kids EastEnders Friends Theory of conduct About a Boy Pitaten Kodocha Incest Fathers' rights Maison Ikkoku Saved by the Bell The Human Stain Polygamy Miss Saigon Henry VIII of England Family name Ten Commandments Divorce Boston Public Domestic violence Laura Schlessinger Juliana of the Netherlands Baby Blues Phoebe Halliwell Too Short a Season (TNG episode) Knots Landing One Tree Hill (TV series) Dog training Incarnations of Immortality Malcolm in the Middle Heir Apparent Great Teacher Onizuka Good Times Generation Y The Critic Earth Girl Arjuna Humphrey Bogart Plame affair James Dobson Gwen Stacy Vegeta Polyamory Mary, the mother of Jesus Abortion debate Order of succession Marriage Spanking John the Baptist Charmed Avatar: The Last Airbender Empress L__ Zhi The Adventures of Pete & Pete Everwood Pitcairn sexual assault trial of 2004 One Life to Live The Fairly OddParents Androgen insensitivity syndrome Jam (TV series) Romulus and Remus History of British nationality law Motion picture rating system Silent Night, Deadly Night Grief Age of consent Attachment theory Religion and sexuality Milton H.
