i'm in need of serious advise my daughter will be next month and when i get with my husband she was months old we have never told her that she was adopted by him but in the last few weeks this lady that we know has mentioned it to her a few times now she hasn't questioned us about it but i feel we should tell her before she hears it from someone else my husband is upset that i want to tell her because he said he sees her as his own child and doesnt want to tell her i've made the decision to tell her and i just dont know how to go about doing it has anyone had any situations like this or did this happen to you and how did you handle it my reasoning for telling her is that if she does find out from someone else i think it'll be better she hears it from us and with her being so young i dont think it'll affect as much if she was in her teens i just realized i can't spell advice lol ok first off this woman had no right in the world to tell your daughter that kind of stuff what the heck was she thinking people need to worry about their own selves and not everyone else secondly your daughter is a very smart mature person im sure but you have to look at it this way shes still young if your worried about how she'd feel about the situation then talk to her about it let her continue to grow up and help her learn that a father isnt always about genetics teach her that if she were to ever find out like if she needed blood or medical wise it would be a very bad time for her to find out if she grows up thinking she is related to him by blood it will be harder to understand the truth if she were to find out which would really make her confused and i dont think you'd want her to go through that just be honest at first it takes a great person to step in as a father to someone elses child your hubby has a kind heart that she already knows but teach her how great of a father he really is by telling the truth theres no worries theres no lies theres just trust and love even though it doesnt start out that way at first your daughter is young and i promise you its the best thing to do show her just how much she and you are loved One Tree Hill (TV series) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Pitaten Infantilism Theory of conduct Kodocha Social rule Milton H.
