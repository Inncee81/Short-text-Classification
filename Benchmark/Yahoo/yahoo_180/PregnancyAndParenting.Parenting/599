why do parents let their children scream in public i see people who let their kids scream at the top of their lungs in public places hit the parents curse at their parents tell their parents what to do etc i really want to know who taught you parents to let your children run all over you i'm sorry when i was a child this was not tolerated and if i attempted to do some of these things i would have had a sore rear end from having my behind spanked some people say this is not a good form of punishment but i tell you what i knew my place growing up and i knew they're were serious consequnces to bad behavior in my house and to this day i have not been in trouble i see parents trying to do the time out and just telling them don't do that form of punishment and i have yet to see that improve their childrens behavior i think that if some of you parents learned to take control of your children like they use to years ago your children might learn a little respect for you as well as stay out of trouble because a lot of parents out there are to scared to discipline their kids because of the nosy a other mother's out there that think that a swat on the butt is child abuse and go running to report it or they like to gasp and give the how dare you hit your child look thank goodness in texas it is legal yes legal to physically discipline your child i by no means believe in beating a child but a smack when the situation calls for it is okay with me to many moms want to be more lovey dovey with their kids but hey my generation we all got spankings and we turned out fine obviously all this time out crap isn't working because look at all the young hooligans out there i so agree with you parents stop spoiling your kids and learn to discipline them time out just isn't working now watch how much criticism i will get for that saying that i must not be a mom yes i have two kids a yr old and a month old so i do know how it goes when kids have meltdowns but screaming at the top off your lungs because they didn't get a toy or whatever it was they wanted isn't having a meltdown it is called a spoiled child that is used to getting what they want to shut them up Spanking Corporal punishment The Marshall Mathers LP Humphrey Bogart Shaggy dog story Baby Blues Infantilism Punishment EastEnders Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Pitaten James Dobson Child Bart chalkboard gags Theory of conduct Futurama (TV series - season 2) The Inside Rocko's Modern Life Codename: Kids Next Door Child abuse Pakistani cricket team in West Indies in 2005 Kodocha Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Poker jargon Great Teacher Onizuka Buttocks Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Malcolm in the Middle Milton H.
