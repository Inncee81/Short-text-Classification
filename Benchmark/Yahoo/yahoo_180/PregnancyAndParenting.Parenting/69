anybody else counting down the days till the kids go back to school i know i am i just can't wait until august th comes its monday they go back on wednesday aug th yay i love having my kids at home with me during the summer but by the end of the summer they are as ready to go back as i am for them to not because i dont want them around but because we have run out of things to do around here i dont have a car during the week so there isnt much that they can do outside of this house and going back to school gets them out of the house and gives them something to do besides watch tv or play in the dirt plus its so hot i have not been pushing them to stay outside much i dread the homework and early mornings but seeing them having something constructive to do is worth it Billboard Hot 100 The Family from One End Street Full Metal Panic?
