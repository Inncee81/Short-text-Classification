how old were you when you had your first child did it make you grow up how did it change your perception i love to read comments stories of how children have enhanced the lives of their parents too often i hear of how children are a burden or they cost a lot of money and my kids bring me grief and so on while these things are certainly unescapable there are many wonderful memories and dreams to come about our legacies will you share your experience i honestly believed i had everything figured out when it came to kids i was and married had a degree in child development and childhood education tons of babysitting and teaching experiences under my belt and couldn't possibly think of anything else i would need to know to parent a child i was all set had the baby's room painted and full of furniture every baby gadget i thought the baby might use and all i needed was for him to pop out so i could start to be the world's best mom my son nicholas was born on march two weeks early and by march i knew that i was no where near prepared as i thought i was no the baby didn't get up every x hours like i learned in school he didn't use x amount of diapers or fall alseep after drinking x amount of formula by god he came weeks early and threw me all off i remember calling my mom stressed out and crying nicholas isn't following what i learned in school she laughed and said you mean he didn't read up before he came out i told him he had until the mid march you can't parent from a book and you can always go by what you read i had a big reality check as weeks when on it seemed like everything i had learned in school was wrong when it came to my son i learned to work around him what little dances and songs i had to sing and do to get him to sleep how much clothing to put on him how to change his diaper when to do household chores when i should sleep when i should eat when to do this and when to do that and what worked best for me and my son parenting wasn't a piece of cake like i thought it would be but i got better at it and learned through trial and error and little tips here and there from my mom and others i couldn't believe how much stuff i bought that the baby nevered used it's the best way to learn through experience when my nd one came along two years later i was prepared as they got older and i added more children to my family you learn to manage to take one day at a time and enjoy what is life throws at you maybe things don't go as you planned but the most imporant thing i learned when i became a parent is to just go with it if he doesn't make it to soccer practice on time if he doesn't get an a on his test if he doesn't learn to share by a certain age or write his name at a certain age i work with them and fix the problem i'm now a mother of boys ages and and am pregnant with a little girl i'm preparing for whatever surprises she brings to the family lol EastEnders Friends Shaggy dog story Infantilism One Tree Hill (TV series) Humphrey Bogart About a Boy The Catcher in the Rye Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Piccolo Junior Saga Extreme Programming Pitaten Great Teacher Onizuka Blood on the Tracks Kurt Cobain Characters in the Smurfs Avenue Q Milton H.
