what should we have done okay this relates to the etiquette yesterday my husband and i took our two year old and our month old to the zoo about noon we sat down to have lunch we were done eating but i was leaning over to help the baby cram cheerios in his mouth when i felt someone reach in front of me and grab my soda hubby had gone to throw out the trash and i thought it was him so i said without looking up back off buddy that's mine then i heard him yell hey what are you doing from about three feet away i looked up and this or year old boy was looking down my shirt and holding my soda he was also way too close to my kids i jumped up and yelled hey the kid threw the soda at me and ran away laughing my husband yelled what are you doing and started toward the kid then these two women said leave him alone he has autism we backed right down and said oh i sorry we didn't mean to yell at him i didn't know i'm sorry and so on they sat down right next to us and each lit cigarettes we sat there feeling awkward and then packed the kids up as quickly as possible my husband asked if i wanted the soda and i said no so they were close enough to hear us and offered to buy a new one we decinled and they bought one anyway we still declined and ran away with our tails between our legs mostly to get away from an ackward situation but also to get the kids away from the smoke i felt like our over reaction was even more insulting than yelling at the kids anyone who parents children with differences what should we have done not that it is likely to happen again but what is a better way to respond sorry he didn't spash the soda on me just threw the cup back at at me i caught it you did the right thing even kids with autism can be taught some manners depending on the severity of it it's not as if you knew he was autistic anyones first reaction is going to be to yell regardless i'm sure they are used to having him yelled at if this is part of his typical behavior so it wasn't any matter to them aside from the fact i'm sure they may have felt bad as evident by them buying you a drink personally after i yelled and they pointed out to me he was autistic i would have said okay no worries then left it at that Autism Shaggy dog story Mojave people Controversies in autism Autism rights movement Milton H.
