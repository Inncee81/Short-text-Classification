im so confused yahoo people have a big difference of opinion should an unstable abusive parent have rights to be involved in their childs life this is not a situation where its a matter of parent no longer liking the other this is simply about knowing this parent will habitually abuse the child do you people really think ''the child should still ''be able to see their parent'' c mon also doesnt the child have the right to be protected why wait until the child comes home one day saying ''daddy touched me here'' yes i believe a child has a right to know who their bio parents are but that doesnt mean they need to be invovlved in their life if you know they will be abused also you cannot always sit around and wait for the courts to do their paperwork to get the visits supervised we need to protect our children some of you people suggest unless theres ''proof''the abuse should continue until there is proof what a beautifull world we live in also anyone who is familiar with family abuse knows how difficult it can be to get proof esp depending on what ''kind'' of abuse this is if a parent is abusive they should have no rights the ability to procreate does not make you a parent Divorce Fathers' rights Infantilism Abortion debate British nationality law Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Domestic violence Autism rights movement Drug abuse Narcissism Dissociative identity disorder Adoption Alexander Technique Indian nationality law Slander and libel Hikikomori Trademark Who is a Jew?
