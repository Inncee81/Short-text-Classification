at what age do you think it is ok for a boy and girl to stay over at each other house in the same bed taking into account they are mature responsible and have been in the relationship for over years thank you in my country the legal age is we don't believe until waiting for marriage when you say 'staying in the same bed' you obviously mean having sex the 'nature' has ordained males and females to coupulate to produce off springs so that the species continue for that it has established a 'start up' point which is puberty for both males and females in animal kingdom other than the humans natural instinct guides the animals however humans have developed brains and it can and has find out the right time of starting sexual activities we the humans have determined that though people can have sex at and sometimes even before puberty the body is not fully ready for child bearing for some more years after that also humans are social animals and we are responsible towards our societies which include our off springs we cannot simply produce them and leave them to fend for themselves therefore all over the civilized societies of the world the age of years has been established as the time when an individual is considered ready physically mentally economically and socially to bear the burden of his her responsibilities there are exceptions too risking to be branded as 'moralistic' which i am not in a narrow sense i would say that a boy and a girl should not indulge into sexual activities before and that too not befoer they get married to each other point here is not of morals but of responsibility towards children society we all know that children of single parents broken homes face tremendous tress in their growing stage and are highly prone to end up in wrong direction having safe sex using contraceptives is a way out but most of the time sexual urge is uncontrollable which may result into unwanted pregnancies putting much great stress on girls' as also boys' lives your contention of they being mature responsible i would ask what is the yard stick for that which boy and or girl would say he she is not mature or responsible and as for being in relationship for over two years many times a whole life is insufficient to understand each other else why would there be so many divorces that too within a few years of marriage not too long ago there was a time in western societies when there were more children of an individual than the number of marriages he she had now the trend is reversing and time is not far when there will be more marriages than children in one's life Puberty Marriage Human sexual behavior Child sexuality Gender role Abortion debate Sexual differentiation Same-sex marriage Sexual abstinence Sex Transsexuality Human Adolescence Religion and sexuality Human sexuality Statutory rape Zoophilia Divorce Sex education The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex Child sexual abuse Childlove movement Sexual revolution Heterosexuality Intersexuality Infantilism History of sex Child Abortion Dog Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Laura Schlessinger Biology and sexual orientation Person Sexual orientation Teenage pregnancy Anal sex Human nature Girl Homosexuality and Christianity Roman Catholic Church sex abuse scandal Sociology Religion and sexual orientation Narcissism Lawrence v.
