new life new worries my son's father hardly comes to get him on the weekends or ever he's lied on me to his mom about coming to get the baby his girlfriend and him work together which is twelve hours five six days a week and on the weekends he spends time with her and her three children if he has our son he leaves him with his mom which is not a problem i'm just saying how do i go about confronting him about spending time with his son or even taking the initiative to come and get him instead of waiting on me to call squeaky first of all sorry for the length of this but your question really touched my heart you see i was in the same situation years ago and what broke my heart is the look on the childs face when he is let down over and over again what made our situation really bad was that his child support was only dollars every days that wouldn't even cover his diapers what i did was simple one day after yet another let down i took that little year old child in my arms and hugged him while he cried yet again i had to find answers to questions like why does daddy hate me what did i do to make daddy stop loving me i told him that a father is not the person that made him but rather the person that raises him and i made him a promise then and there that i will be his father from now on this of course made things a little difficult when his father did want to go pick him up because i would always have something planned for him to do with me and he did not want to go with his biological dad soon enough he was calling me daddy and as he grew older dad we did everything together and i treated him equally and like he was my own even my family knowing full well the situation sees him and treats him as if he were my biological son soon his father actually stopped sending the child support altogether it did not matter because he had everything he needed and so much more now years later that little kid is a college man he is an incredible human being with all the right values and all the right teachings every time we see each other regardless of where he is or what he is doing he will always stop come over to me give me a kiss on the cheek and throw his arms around me whenever he introduces me he doesn't say here is my dad he says this is my father one day recently i told him his biological father asked about him but he cut me short and said he was not interested in what the man had to say i told him look you may not like it but he is your father imagine my surprise when he told me the words i spoke to him so many years ago my father is not the man that made me but rather the man that raised me and gave everything for me everytime he goes to do something whether it's sports school whatever he always says to me i'll make you proud dad squeaky isn't this worth having if you think so you grab that kid in your arms and you hug him and do everything you can for him protect his feelings from the lack of fatherly love play with him study with him take him with you wherever you go and one day many years from now you will be where i am today the happiest proudest father to walk the earth take care Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Shaggy dog story About a Boy The Amber Spyglass Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Fathers' rights Kodocha Infantilism Kyle Broflovski Theory of conduct Friends Futurama (TV series - season 5) Sin City Piccolo Junior Saga The Fairly OddParents Hey Jude Miss Saigon Wild at Heart (Buffy episode) Pitaten One Tree Hill (TV series) Grandview, U.S.A.
