my son and adhd so i believe that my son has adhd he is yr old and about to go into the second grade he was constantly in trouble in the first grade he almost was expelled for bad behavior he was suspended form school a total of times it was seeming like the school was shoving meds down my throat and that they looked at me like i was a horrible parent because i wanted to explore all other options first i cut out caffeine alot of sugary foods and did my absolute best to work on him and his behavior nothing is working i feel like a failure it is taking time to get him state medical benefits and i am desperately trying to get him to be seen by a doc but i dont make alot of money even if i do get him to see a doc i heard that adhd meds are extremely expensive and i doubt i will be able to afford them i dont know what to do and i am at my wits end it seems like my son just doesnt have the ability to do some things on his own and i want to help him sooo badly my son has adhd the meds for this are really expensive and most of them don't have a generic depending on what kind you get mine cost a month i have my son on a low dosage because as you are i'm concerned with the long term effects try some of these tips that the doctor told me if your son truly has adhd caffeine will help try giving him a cup of coffee in the morning and see if this calms him down keep him off the sugar because sugar doesn't help just the caffeine my doctor suggested coffee in the morning and for him to take something like mountain dew or a vault for snack this helps a lot caffeine has an adverse reaction on adhd patients on someone without it it hypes them up just like the meds would but this will counter react with adhd just like the meds do and cause him to calm down strattera is the only drug on the market that does not have amphetamine in it which is what is concerning about the other drugs but it is expensive a month i do not know if there is a generic but that would be something to google also have you tried looking into government mandated programs i don't know where you live but you could check into medicaid or all kids insurance all you have to do is go to your local department of human resources or look on the net good luck because lord knows i've been through what you are going through and now is the time to deal with it because they won't even put children on the meds until they start school you don't want his education to suffer Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Caffeine Drug addiction Adult attention-deficit disorder Breastfeeding Methylphenidate Chronic fatigue syndrome Health insurance Migraine Medicine Publicly funded medicine Folic acid Hypoglycemia Methamphetamine Urinary incontinence Health care in the United States Little Britain Addiction Illegal drug trade Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Coffee Education in the United States Microeconomics Pitaten Insomnia Insurance Sleep Fecal incontinence Asthma Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Atomoxetine Saved by the Bell Obesity Autism Al Gore presidential campaign, 2000 Pharmaceutical company Hyperactivity Anxiety Ben Johnson (athlete) Wal-Mart Drug abuse Life insurance Bipolar disorder Neurofeedback Graduate school Cocaine Malaria Supply and demand Chocolate Tobacco smoking Social rule Rofecoxib Growth hormone treatment Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Education in the People's Republic of China Amphetamine Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma LSD Medical cannabis Theory of conduct Social Security debate (United States) Stomach cancer Procrastination Allergy Bradley Nowell Word of Wisdom Traumatic brain injury Humphrey Bogart Crohn's disease Food and Drug Administration Antipsychotic Medicare (United States) Economy of the United States Blackjack Buprenorphine Common cold Neighbours Sleep apnea Student loan Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Alcoholism Mountain Dew Gastroesophageal reflux disease National Kidney Foundation Singapore Breakfast Food Paracetamol Political economy Commodity markets Milton H.
