a question for people who have never smoked pot what do you imagine the short term physical and psychological effects of smoking pot are i am only referring to the time you are actually high from smoking not long term effects such as lung damage exactly they wouldn't know yet they assume that the effects are so tremendous that people can't even care for children when smoking small amounts i've never smoked it but i don't have to 'imagine' the effects it has on people i've lived in environments that were saturated with pot in varying degrees and i saw some of the effects it had lazy and neglectful parenting domestic violence crime and unemployment to name a few i like how you assume people are 'uneducated' about something like this because they haven't done it have you considered the fact that some people overcame their ignorance by learning from the mistakes of others that they saw all around them it's sad the way these days some people wear drug use like a badge of honour edit i read your other question if you're so insecure about smoking pot around your children try not doing it instead of a crusade to convince people that being on drugs while you attempt to care for your children is ok Cannabis (drug) Causality Drug abuse Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Tobacco smoking Cancer Psychology Diving Motivation Divorce Infantilism Drug addiction Nuclear explosion The Smoking Room Plame affair Betting (poker) Illegal drug trade Coercion Cocaine Consensual crime Lung cancer Methamphetamine Explosive material Stroke Hypertension Adoption Gender role The Marshall Mathers LP Cannabis rescheduling in the United States Sub-Zero Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Medical cannabis Narcissism Characters in the Smurfs Spanking Health insurance Down syndrome Kurt Cobain Microeconomics Theodicy Transsexuality Unemployment Smoking ban Neuro-linguistic programming Goodness and value theory Child abuse Growth hormone treatment Social rule Attachment theory The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy Prostate cancer Ionizing radiation Breastfeeding Hollyoaks Fire fighting Radar Culture of the United States Rape Anger management Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Philosophical skepticism Cigarette Smoking Man Religion Urinary incontinence Sauna Deprogramming Asthma Stomach cancer Wealth Hand grenade Child sexual abuse Addiction Daredevil Domestic violence Same-sex marriage Autism Drowning 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Donovan Hikikomori Langmuir probe Normal distribution Model minority Anti-Semitism Asperger syndrome Decompression sickness Japanese tea ceremony Borderline personality disorder Alcohol fuel Carl Jung No Child Left Behind Act Poker jargon Aikido Democratic Kampuchea Non-native pronunciations of English
