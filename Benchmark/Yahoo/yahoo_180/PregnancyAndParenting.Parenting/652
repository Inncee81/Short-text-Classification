three cheers for child abuse hip hip hurray people are so quick to grab a belt or paddle to solve their problems with out of control kids hell if thats the case why don't we let cops grab black sticks to solve out of control adults oh no we're against that but we aren't against letting complete f cking strangers spank our kids in school oh yea there has been a lot of talk in congress about reinstating that teachers can spank kids and swarms of parents showed up at the hearing now i'd think they'd show up to abolish this idea oh no they were there to support it as have many people her on yahoo answers as ive seen asked by people if this should be allowed and the best answers given to those who say yes let some stranger i hardly know beat the sh t out of my misbehaving kids is this right how the hell can people be so adamant about beating their kids or letting others beat their kids i'm not asking everyone to agree with me cause personally i'm against spanking your kids spanking your kids to me is no different then punching them in the face trisha i don't think i have seriously heard anyone on ya condone beatings as you keep referring to it really heres one katie a woman once told me the only way to raise an obidient child is to beat them wwhen they stepped out of line heres two misty when my son is bad i beat his little a heres three kim i beat the hell out of them just to let them know that it's not tolerated these are just a fraction of the responses from people ive read that bothered me here on ya good point everyone wants to strangers to beat the kids but no one wants to get their azz beat when they break the law also to all that think oh it's just a couple swats its not a beating you know dam well that if they spank your kid its not gonna be a swat they and most of you tear that azz up to try and teach them a lesson because you know if you just give em a tap or a little swat they just gonna laugh at you and do it again in spite and the cycle continues and then you probably end up with an abusive adult if not something worse down the line since you taught him her that hitting is the answer problems they can't handle but really if you have to resort to spankings or paddlings to discipline it really just shows how bad a job you did raising them and or how bad your parents were Spanking Avenue Q Shawn Michaels Paddle (spanking) True Crime: Streets of LA Sin City Theory of conduct Buttocks EastEnders James Dobson Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Boston Public Child abuse Shaggy dog story AVN Awards Criticism of government response to Hurricane Katrina Little Britain The Marshall Mathers LP The Inside Boxing Social rule Escape from New York Jennifer Lopez Transactional analysis Columbine High School massacre Jam (TV series) Fred Phelps Aerial (dance move) Syphon Filter Russian joke Recurring South Park characters 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Erotic spanking Beavis and Butt-head Hazing Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Serial killer Condon Committee Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Infantilism Domestic violence Kender Reincarnation Great Teacher Onizuka Teachers (film) Theodicy Mumia Abu-Jamal Rocko's Modern Life Professional wrestling attacks Punishment U.S. presidential election debates, 2004 Humphrey Bogart Professional wrestling aerial techniques The Contender (television series) Education About a Boy Divorce Whose Line Is It Anyway?
