question for single mommies or mommies who were once single mommies though its hard under any circumstance do you think it's easier emotionally to become a single mom while pregnant or after the baby arrives and you parent together for at least a short period of time why im weeks along he has decided hes leaving because i wont put her up for adoption i can see how one might feel this situation to be empowering i just pray to god i made a decent mother and can successfully do this on my own not to mention the social stigma around being an unwed single mother i think it depends on the circumstances around the ending of the relationship as well as the support the mom has and also if the father stays involved in my case my sons father left me at months pregnant because i wouldnt have an abortion he pays child support but chooses not to be involved in my sons life if he had left after my son was born i am sure that it would have been harder on me being single and pregnant was hard but emotionally it was actually very easy it was sort of empowering in a way because i know alot of women would have gotten an abortion also there was another lady that i worked with who had the exact same thing happen that the guy split when she found out having someone that i saw everyday who was dealing with the same thing as me made it alot easier i chose also to look at the brighter side of things for example i was single and pregnant but atleast i wasnt pregnant by a loving husband who had died when i was months pregnant compared to women who go through that i had it easy Abortion debate EastEnders Marriage Divorce Roe v.
