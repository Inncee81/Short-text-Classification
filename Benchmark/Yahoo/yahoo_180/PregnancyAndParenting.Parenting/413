i used to want to name my daughter chastity but not anymore what do you think of desera and my son gob hi i decided not to name my daughter chastity because people will make fun of her in school what do you think of the name desera should i name her desera or desray and my son what do you think of the name gob pronounced jobe with a hard j is that how you would spell it or should i spell it jobe ok people i obviously don't want a name for my kids that everyone has herd of why because there are so many other people with those names now that it would be lame and unoriginal for me to name them that desera is pronounced des erah its not that hard d soft e s r soft a and to avoid the job problem people would say the o as a soft o if i add an e to the end right so if i name him jobe it sounds like jobe right the alternative to my daughters name could be clairece and i don't want to name my kids this to be creative i also really like those names especially desera why is desera an ugly name and weeder not all names have to be real words desiree that would be syllables and sound like desire that is so porn i think des ruh is actually the best way to spell the pronunciation of the way i want her name to be pronounced there is a fine line of wanting your children's names to be unique and child abuse and by naming your children these funky names you are close to crossing that line i can understand desera i've heard that one before and i could even understand job it's biblical but why are you so determined to spell them so strangely that they will never be pronounce or spelled correctly by people who do not know them just imagine a lifetime of having to correct your misspelled name on official documents or having to repeat the phrase actually it's pronounced why would you intentionally do that to a person maybe you want to be unique but did you ever stop to think that your children may not share that desire International Phonetic Alphabet Hangul Non-native pronunciations of English Dutch language Greek language Shibboleth New Zealand English Slovak language Bulgarian language French language Sesotho language English language Arabic alphabet Standard Cantonese Liaison Korean language Phoneme Singlish Chinese language Thai alphabet Indonesian language Leet Speech synthesis Apostrophe (mark) Vishnu sahasranama Misspelling Revised Romanization of Korean Polish language NATO phonetic alphabet Scottish Gaelic language Hindi Quebec French Vietnamese language Canadian English Hanja Dictionary Korean name Spoken Finnish Family name Russian phonology Japanese name English English Written Cantonese Australian English Kanji Sindarin Vowel Mispronunciation Hebrew language Pinyin Chinese character Tetragrammaton Taiwanese (linguistics) Mantra Arabic name Finnish language Cyrillic alphabet Cantonese (linguistics) Arabic language Latin alphabet Phonology World Wide Web Stuttering Wolof language Hypercorrection Phonics English plural R__maji Portuguese language Names of God in Judaism English spelling Whose Line Is It Anyway?
