around what age should my baby be when i get her ears pierced well as parents its totally up to you i pierced my daughters ears at months then i took themout cause she lost one she would always play with her ears then it wasnt until about months later i went to put them in and they were closed so we had to re pierce them it was better this time she didnt touch them and was ok with it later on though we took them out she has sensitive ears and wanted to change them but because she was more aware she didnt want us touching her ears she is now and will ask me to put them on or take them off totally up to her i say pierce them and if it bothers her take them out just every month or so check to see if they are still open i say younger the better the pain is not as rememberable Body piercing Earring Traumatic brain injury Violin Comanche Milton H.
