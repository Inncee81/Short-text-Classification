what good does it do what are we teaching our children by bickering about which way to discipline a child is correct or which parent is wrong by doing different things its a debate that has been going on for many decades now and will continue to go on regardless of what we think isnt the whole point to get advice on problems and talk to other parents on how to be more responsible and caring parents instead of pointing fingers about who is doing bad and who is doing good i think that the whole parenting world would be different if we could stop pointing fingers and start working together it sounds so cliche to say we should all work together and support each other and all that but in some ways that is what should be happening if all we do is point fingers and place blame then we will never grow however there are some instances where a parent needs to be called out immediately because they are doing something bad this is probably a lot less frequent but unfortunately this will never change Theory of conduct Milton H.
