why do some parents on here keep trying to shove their parenting beliefs down other people throats anyone ever wonder why there are cliques in high school why the popular kids make fun of the not popular kids why the rich kids make fun of the poor kids its because they learn it from their parents some of the parents on here are prime examples why are people on here so gung ho about cramming their beliefs down other parents throats does how another parent raise their kid really affect you no but there are some parents on here who seem to think that their way is the only way and are just going overboard trying to convince the rest of us to jump on board why do they care you don't agree with spanking you don't think moms should work outside the home you don't agree with formula feeding you don't think parents should use daycare great wonderful good for you so how does it affect any of you in the least because there are those who think differently live your life and raise your kids how you see fit and dont worry how others do it spanking causing someone to have road rage or to become a murderer wow thats a new one for me ha ha ha this is not a debate on spanking vs not spanking or any other subject but i'll just say that i was spanked growing up and so were both my parents my mom has never been arrested neither has my dad and i haven't either none of us has ever murdered anyone either big shocker huh formula feeding moms are all just welfare addicts huh wow thats a new one your concerned with how much you might have to pay out in taxes because there are moms who use formula well maybe some of us are concerned with our kids having to go to public schools with your stuck up self centered kids who have learned their judgmental behavior from you think about the big picture iola stop the vote you already have mine not because you agree with me or how i parent my kids since i don't know if you would or not but because you understood the point i was making very good point if we want our kids to accept and be accepted for who they are we should lead by example and accept others for who they are even if we differ in opinion not everything has to be done the same way to be done correctly exactly not everything has to be done the same way to be done correctly if we cant use some maturity and simple human kindness and realize that we need to worry about our own kids instead of how some woman halfway across the country raises hers then how can anyone expect their kids to me and my husband work hard we pay our own bills no one out there in this country is having to support my kids my husbands job and he pay his insurance premiums not some stanger on yahoo answers so no one else is paying for it because i formula fed my daughter briefly although i do breastfeed and am definately an advocate when need be i really don't care about others choices sigh but since you ask babies who are formula fed get sick more a lot of women who give their babies formula are on assisstance so our taxes are paying for their doctor visits medications and moms on wic get a lot free formula that's my husbands hard earned money that could be spent elsewhere but hell i feel that way about the war formula puts too much money into the banks of corporate companies while draining our own pockets lol of course not all mothers who use formula are on assisstance but it is ignorant to think that more are not people with more money and higher education are breastfeeding or paying their own way like you the low income bracket is outstanding in this country and since when was the big picture being concerned about our kids going to school with snobs lol that's funny Breastfeeding Health insurance Economic inequality Microeconomics Divorce Kyle Broflovski Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Sexual orientation Inflation Publicly funded medicine Hillary Rodham Clinton Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Humphrey Bogart Bond Education in the United States Infantilism Capitalism Annuity Tax National Kidney Foundation Singapore Flat tax Recurring South Park characters Government debt The Apprentice 2 Doug EastEnders Supply-side economics Unemployment Goodness and value theory Freeters Human sexual behavior Laura Schlessinger Terri Schiavo Fred Phelps Milton H.
