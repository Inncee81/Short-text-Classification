i have year old twin boys should they have different nd grade class they have been in same class since preschool this year they've started soccer and i put them on different teams they are still ambiguos about that we haven't had games yet just practice it's a small rural school and there was never an oppourtunity to split them before though i wouldn't have tried untill kicergarten or st grade i think they are both brilliant it's just htat one always has to outshine the other and i think it could hurt them later along with being too dependant on each other kids always see black white chocolate or vanilla boy a or boy b and unfortunatly some teachers do to the school assigned them to the same class without talking to me and my boys saw the letter but i told them nothing was certain yet they liked the idea of sharing again but they share a room at home it just feels like time for them to split a little should i listen to them or my instincts should have been more specific they aren't direct competitors in soccer they practice together and the rest with teams and they are playing lots of different teams in fact i checked and they will probably never play each other if they do they might be sick that day listen to your instinct and listen to their teachers i have twins boys and they were in kindergarten together but have been separated since then they didn't do well the first few weeks in pre school i tried them in separate classes and the teachers suggested i put them together it still took a few months for them to be comfortable without their twin standing next to them in kindergarten i didn't want the same thing to happen since it was going to be a new school so i requested them to be together in the end they were fine the kindergarten teacher told me they were very different learners something i had also noticed at home and suggested the be separated in st grade its been that way ever since i find it hard to not compare them sometimes and i don't want to put that pressure on the teachers also if they look alike it could cause a problem my friend has twins in the same class small private school so no choice their teacher couldn't remember which one did the better job on an oral project and decided to average the grade one of the biggest cons is the homework in st grade one teacher only gave homework over the weekend to be due the next tuesday the other give homework throughout the week it made scheduling a bit difficult another is that one class or teacher may be more fun or offer more class incentives the one that mattered most to my sons birthday parties a lot of families just say invite the boys in your class some don't know or remember that there are twins it's happened a few times where one is invited and not the other i just do something special with the one at home good luck either way make sure the school allows for discussion every year things may change even in between years to make you want to keep them together or separate them Social rule Shaggy dog story Education in the United States Theory of conduct Education in Romania Education in Germany Grade (education) Kindergarten Education in the People's Republic of China Kodocha Teen Girl Squad Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Ocean's Twelve Extreme Programming Milton H.
