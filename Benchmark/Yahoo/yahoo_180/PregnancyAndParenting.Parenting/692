should we have a baby my husband and i have an month old son and we want to have another the only problem is he is deploying to the middle east in march we usually don't let the military change how we want to live our life and my husband says it's okay to have the baby when he is deployed he doesn't want to put our lives on hold when we want to have them close together i'm a little skeptical what do you think my husband will be back within the first months of his birth at least after that his enlistment is up and he will be home i am moving home with my parents for the time being so i will have a lot of support that is such a hard decision i'm not sure what i would do we have a month old and i really want another one too i think i would have to be selfish and have another one he'll be back in a year right so he will miss the pregnancy and birth but he'll be back for your baby before your baby knows he's missing i say do it Abortion debate Hollyoaks Friends Prenatal diagnosis Pregnancy EastEnders Hall & Oates Childbirth Breastfeeding Knots Landing USS Vogelgesang (DD-862) Infant Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Abortion in the United States Postpartum depression Laura Schlessinger Melanie Wilkes Urinary incontinence USS Taussig (DD-746) Miscarriage Premature birth Miss Saigon Search for Tomorrow USS Ammen (DD-527) Birth weight USS Walke (DD-723) Baby Blues Kate Vaiden Humphrey Bogart Boston Public Breech birth USS Yorktown (CV-10) Charmed USS Allen M.
