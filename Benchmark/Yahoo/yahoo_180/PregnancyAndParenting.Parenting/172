what do you think about so many parents claiming that all rights over their children have been taken as far as i'm aware it's still up to us to discipline our children i know we're not allowed to abuse them in any way but shouldn't that go without saying a lot of people are so disparaging about 'children's rights' but have they considered that there is good reason for those rights to have to be protected in the first place what is your take on this that's all fine but don't you think that there was a reason that children had to be made aware of their rights i'm sorry but i believe that children are entitled to more than just basic physical needs giving children rights doesn't mean losing discipline discipline and a good upbringing is a right too but so many people seem to have the attitude that i made them i can do what i want with them that upsets me they're human beings this is a huge pet peeve of mine parents making comments like that now it's not as if the teachers at the schools are able to punish them for anything that they do outside of the school grounds or at home so i don't know what the parents are talking about there i'm not really certain exactly who is taking these rights away parents are still the final authority over their kids and need to be the ones to teach the proper lessons of right and wrong and dole out the appropriate punishments when something goes wrong i think the first poster is very astute in saying that the modern day idea of parenting is to be a friend to your child especially teenagers when that's really the last thing that they need they have their circle of friends and while yes of course you want to be able to have a friendly relationship with your son or daughter if you're more concerned about them being mad at you for a while and less concerned about them going out and doing something stupid that might get themselves or somebody else seriously hurt or in a great deal of trouble then you've got some things to work out there a parent is first and foremost a teacher and a guide to show their kids the right way to do things and how to be a decent person they are a friend afterwards so that they can still be the person that their child comes to when they need help a lot of parents now are just too self righteous and stubborn to admit that they're going about things the wrong way sorry about the long post just a huge pet peeve of mine let me just climb down off my soap box here Theory of conduct Theodicy Fathers' rights Punishment Kodocha Abortion debate Constitution of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus Property (ownership right) Boston Public Corporal punishment Animal rights Spanking Ten Commandments Autism rights movement James Dobson Saved by the Bell Justification (theology) The nature of God in Western theology Friends Kender Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Ethics Pitaten Homeschooling EastEnders Laura Schlessinger About a Boy Confucius Sant Thakar Singh Child Good Times The Fairly OddParents Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Polyamory Domestic violence Education Utilitarianism School discipline Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Great Teacher Onizuka Reincarnation God Emperor of Dune Religion Capital punishment Our Gang Economics Teacher's Pet (Disney) Malcolm in the Middle Military opposition to the Reconciliation, Tolerance, and Unity Bill (Fiji) Narcissism Plame affair Atheism Scientology beliefs and practices Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder My Parents are Aliens Infant baptism Nicomachean Ethics Motion picture rating system Adoption Evil Criticism of libertarianism Hell Aristotle Carlos Castaneda Comparing and contrasting Judaism and Christianity Children of God The Book of Five Rings Michel Foucault Polygamy Zoophilia Person Alignment (role-playing games) Alcoholics Anonymous Education in the People's Republic of China Rich Mullins Tai Chi Chuan Dog training The Death Gate Cycle Charles Grandison Finney Separation of church and state The Catcher in the Rye Motivation Excommunication History of British nationality law The Apprentice 2 The Human Stain Fundamental Rights, Directive Principles and Fundamental Duties of India John the Baptist
