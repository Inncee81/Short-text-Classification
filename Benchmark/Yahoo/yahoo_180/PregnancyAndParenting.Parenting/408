just a quick question to parents if you responded rudely to a question i asked or were disrespectful would you consider it a learning experience if i gave you a quick pop on the butt it's padded so it shouldn't hurt and after all your actions need to bring about consequences for you to learn from is that ok disney chick you hit the nail on the head it wasn't meant to be veiled lol i am pointing out the ridiculousness of the argument that fervent 'pro spankers' consistantly present as a matter of fact i have never been 'against' spanking but the ignorant and childish 'parents' who consistantly tell others they are wrong not to spank are a different story it seems many people are so defensive i wonder why when you're so obviously doing the best thing for your child terratad i'm so sorry but your question made no sense i tried to read it and give a response but i wasn't able to understand what you were going on about to a couple of the others who still try to imply that spanking a child is the only way i will just say that as sorry as you appear to feel for me with my children lol i feel ten times sorrier for you and yours best wishes is it ok to ask retarded questions that are really just a cover for a deeper issue like a parent's right to discipline their children how ever they see legally fit that's my take on this question edit ok i see what you did there lol i am pro spanking for my family have i seen children that clearly needed a spanking and wished their parents did as such yes do i have the right to demand others discipline their children as i discipline mine no are there families that make no spanking work and manage to raise well behaved children yes but not as many as they would lead you to believe i think though about your argument that pro spankers feel they have to be on the defensive about their discipline techniques because soooo many anti spankers bring up the ridiculous child abuse remarks but it does go both ways and if we could all be a little more tolerant of other people's choices we would all be much happier my thing is just make your kids behave people don't make the rest of us suffer because your child doesn't understand how to act in public make them understand there are consequences for their actions Spanking Theory of conduct Theodicy Plame affair James Dobson Utilitarianism Eutheism, dystheism, and maltheism Transactional analysis Corporal punishment Goodness and value theory Determinism Abortion debate The nature of God in Western theology Yellow Ribbon campaign (Fiji) Karen Horney Milton H.
