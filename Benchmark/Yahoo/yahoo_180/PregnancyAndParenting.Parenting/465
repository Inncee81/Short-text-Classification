should parents be required to control their kids on airplanes this story happened in july it's about a mother and her month old son getting kicked off of a plane the reason the child kept screaming bye bye plane repeatedly now the mother is considering legal action because she was asked to leave the flight personally i think the parents should be responsible for controlling their kids it's really inconsiderate to others if you let your kid scream and throw tantrums the mother in the video said she didn't have food diapers etc but all of those things can be bought in the airport watch the video here http video yahoo com video play vid fr yfp t what are your thoughts people who agree with the flight attendant aren't blaming the kid they are blaming the parent for not giving the kid a bottle or anything that would prevent an inconsiderate disruption on the plane yes this kid was saying the same thing over and over for a long period of time during which the mother made no effort to quiet the kid at all wasnt it like minutes of this kid saying the same thing i've flown many times with my children when they were young and never had any problems the mother first of all should have shushed the kid what kind of a mother doesnt bring things to occupy the child especially on a flight 2005 trial of Michael Jackson Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Theory of conduct Shaggy dog story Mohamed Atta al-Sayed Fixed-wing aircraft Eddie August Schneider Infantilism Humphrey Bogart The Apprentice 2 Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks The Critic Adoption Motion picture rating system Characters of Lost Urinary incontinence The Catcher in the Rye Airplane!
