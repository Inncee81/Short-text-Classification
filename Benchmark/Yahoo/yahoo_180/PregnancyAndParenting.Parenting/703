stay at home moms what is life like my husband and i found out that we are pregnant with our first i'm about weeks currently i also currenlty work a full time job that brings in half of our income however we both feel strongly that i should become a sahm when the baby is born i'm feeling a little nervous about this though as financially it doesn't add up when i quit we will be about short on our bills trust me we live tight too we don't eat out i cook no credit card debt the hubbie is looking at getting a second job and hopefully i can bring in some income with my small cake business but that's not a sure thing i would really love to hear your stories and or advise on this whole situation thank you no unfortunately the only family in this area is his mother and she is not able to watch our baby i am i have a y o m o and week old when we found out i was pregnant with our first we both agreed that the best thing was for me to stay home and i loved that idea the thought of seeing every single milestone and being close all day long we sat down and wrote down exactly what bills we pay and how much they add up to compared to how much my husband earns a fortnight then we figured out how much we'd have left over and sometimes it may only have been when i got pregnant with our nd my first was months old things were incredibly tight my in laws have nothing to do with one another and my whole family live overseas so we did every single thing and bought almost everything by ourselves we quit eating out to and cancelled our blockbuster account ooooh what i tell every pregnant parent start stocking up on diapers and or formula if you buy a pack of diapers every fortnight then by the time the baby is born you don't have to worry about that expense same on formula if you use it when our nd daughter was months old i found out that i was pregnant with our rd daughter we were managing our finances correctly and he just managed to get overtime at work several occasions things got scary and it came up that he'd have to get a second job but thankfully it hasen't had to happen he is a technician and can get his hands on as much work as possible which has helped us out plus we had to use what was in the retirement funds and also pray that our tax refund was big enough to get ahead if you manage your finances correctly and budget your grocery bill to only what you need that week and will eat and then cut down on electricty and phone bills things aren't that bad we still have more bills going out than what income we have coming in the idea is to just stay ahead in your account to you don't get overdrawn at least this is what works for us right now good luck i'm sure things will work out for you it is scary when i was having our first we actually were ugh living with his mum and dad but his sister called the county who ordered us a citation to get out and two weeks before i delivered we were forced into a hotel room we prayed so hard and two days before we had to leave the hotel with no money my husband happened upon a house for sale the owners worked with us for a year and we were finally able to buy it it was tough i won't lie at times my husband and i did go hungry but our child never went without and we've only come through the entire ordeals stronger closer and happier you will realize your strengths very quickly just stay strong and you will get thorugh it EastEnders Poker jargon Friends Kodocha Gross domestic product Knots Landing Personal finance Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Mutual fund Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Wal-Mart Microeconomics Social rule Social Security (United States) Humphrey Bogart The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie Ocean's Twelve Sharon Tate Shaggy dog story The Amazing Race United Kingdom corporation tax About a Boy New York Giants Infantilism Days of our Lives Boston Public Pitaten Rosa Parks Neighbours Babe Ruth Miss Saigon The Fairly OddParents Charmed Breastfeeding Planning and execution of the September 11, 2001 attacks Mortgage Billboard Hot 100 Hillary Rodham Clinton Plame affair Economy of Russia Leeds United F.C.
