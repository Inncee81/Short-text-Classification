i have sons ages years and months i also have an year old step son the year old is visiting for the next month and my boys haven't seen each other for about a year due to us living a significant distance from his mother before he came to visit my boys were really close and now that he is here my year old ditches my baby to play with his brother i understand that that is probably natural seeing as though they are pretty close and a lot closer in age and to have a little year old hanging around isn't cool but my year old is really upset by this i honestly think that he considers himself to be a big kid usually he follows older kids around and just doesn't play like a baby he wants to be a big boy but like i was saying my baby is really upset everytime they go to ride bikes or whatever and he can't go because he doesn't have a bike but even when they are in the house they will go in their room and close the baby out even though that is his room too and i am just looking for some advice on how to deal with this situation how can i get them all to play yes i do get upset because my baby is upset when they go outside he tries to follow them out of the door and he's screaming and crying and having a tempertantrum everytime they leave them i know they aren't going to be the best of friends but my year old was really close to my year old before and now that the year old came on friday my year old gives him no attention at all i have been trying to spend extra time with him but it's not the same he doesn't want me he wants his brother i'm looking for some suggestions of things that they can all do together so my year old can cope with this a little better my husband and i have a lot of family nights we all sit down at the table and play games we have a lot of games that are for ages four and up and two and up and the older kids can play them and the younger ones sit in our laps and help us play but it's time that we're all spending together as a family also if they want to ride bikes together i think that's ok they are older and they shouldn't have to suffer their play time just because they have a baby sibling but when they go in the bed room the door needs to stay open especially because the bedroom is the younger kids' too Friends EastEnders The Catcher in the Rye Theory of conduct The Shining (film) Kodocha Episodes of Lost (Season 1) The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe Silent Night, Deadly Night The Lovely Bones Social rule Kyle Broflovski Baby Blues Humphrey Bogart What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?
