how can we stop our future children from being idiots i'm planning on popping out a few sprogs with the missus one of these days but the thing is we're terrified of having raising a stupid child you know one of those poor half witted creatures i am very intelligent and so is my wife we desire our child ren to be at least as intelligent as ourselves so what must we do who said anything about iq and who said anything about impressing upon people the fact that they're superior to others don't get angry at me for things you invent read to them talk to them and stimulate their curiosity don't talk down to them or use baby talk popping out a few sprogs with the missus doesn't sound all that intelligent to me so i don't think you need to worry about your children not equaling your intelligence Father's Day (Doctor Who) Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Shit Le Malade imaginaire Childfree Taken American Idiot Shaggy dog story Trailer Park Boys Earth Girl Arjuna Ren and Stimpy Kodocha Plame affair Max Martin The nature of God in Western theology Street-Legal Intelligent design Pinky and the Brain Sharon Tate Pop punk Salad Fingers Social rule Fiddler on the Roof Invader Zim Little Britain Gifted Phoebe Halliwell 8th Genie Awards Kender The Fairly OddParents Anne Rice Grandview, U.S.A.
