does anybody agree that the no child left behind is a load i don't see why i have to waste my time in school just so one person can learn what is narrow cirriculum poor funding etc i just feel that the idea is just stupid normally on these questions i'd go on a big ranting tirade but right now i can't completely say all i want to without getting reported for using the f word times in the same sentence lol jk as a high school student i'm sick of hearing about it and having to deal with it most of the kids they are targeting for it at the school i attend don't care what happens to them in the future i have witnessed a few boys say that they don't care about school that they are happy with working in a factory the rest of their lives but i have to suffer through stupid lesson plans and ramblings and lectures about things that have nothing to do with me The Giver Kyle Broflovski Shit Education in the United States Laura Schlessinger F.
