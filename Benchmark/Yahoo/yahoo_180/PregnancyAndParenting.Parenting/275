how is it possible to forget you have a child in the car i'm not a mother but i know if i had a child i would not forget that they are in the car there has been a rash of these incidents lately and am wondering how is this possible to add to this question no not everyone is perfect but that is ridiculous you carry a child in your stomach for nine months you would think you would excercise a little more caution the only thing i can think of is that they parents are busy and their minds are elsewhere and the baby is asleep so they aren't making any noise but honestly i don't know all i know is that i couldn't forget my son in the car Jam (TV series) Joke Shaggy dog story EastEnders Social rule Episodes of Lost (Season 1) Adoption Philosophical skepticism Humphrey Bogart Treehouse of Horror IX Kender Russian joke Night (book) Friends Childbirth Abortion debate Sudden infant death syndrome Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind Similarities between the Bible and the Qur'an Breastfeeding Infantilism Jon Secada Milton H.
