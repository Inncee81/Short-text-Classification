how reliable accurate are pulse oximeter results without going into a complicated history which involves my son being diagnosed first with asthma like problem then with pneumonia then with pneumonia asthma please tell me if oxigentation measurement done by a pulse oximiter is a reliable indicator of a problem in the absense of other symptoms my year old is behaiving fine eating again and being playful and energetic no breathing problems no wheezing or crackles oxigen was shown to be at this freaked the dr out and she gave us an inhailer with albuterol i don't want to use it my son hates this stuff i'm puzzled at being confronted with a normally behaving child who coughs a little and an oxygen reading which says he needs breathing treatments pulse oximeters are reasonably accurate most of the time it's important to treat the patient not the equipment when in doubt an arterial blood gas is accurate the normal oxygen saturation for a normal healthy person is even when i was having lots of trouble with asthma when i was first diagnosed i was always or better sometimes a pulse oximeter doesn't read properly because of movement light getting to the sensor plastic nails anemia nail polish poor circulation aberrant hemoglobins and there are a few other reasons for a poor reading if your son was at saturation that's low but not critical depending on how your doctor diagnoses asthma she might be very observant and uses all the potential symptoms to see disease there is a possibility that your doctor thinks a cough and low pulse oximeter reading mean that your son has asthma needing treatment depending on the intensity of the cough i would probably agree i think the cough is the most important sign of asthma that you have described if the cough was severe i think your son would have been prescribed an inhaled steroid for daily use if you have an albuterol inhaler for your son what does it say to do with it use x inhalations y or z times a day as needed use x inhalations every four hours maybe your doctor was just being prudent and giving you the resources to treat your son if he has an asthma attack for some background i have asthma i have normal breath sounds a cough that improves with albuterol or inhaled steroid depending on how bad it is i don't cough anything out i get short of breath when working hard i can function just fine in normal activity my pulse ox runs consistently my breathing is normal when i am not symptomatic and you wouldn't be able to tell that i have asthma by looking at me sometimes i use a treatment or two a week of albuterol and sometimes i go on advair because my cough gets bad it all depends on the weather air pollution stress and any asthma triggers i am exposed to i was diagnosed because i had a horrible cough that wouldn't go away Cystic fibrosis Hypertension Stroke Insulin Myocardial infarction Traumatic brain injury Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Decompression sickness Acute respiratory distress syndrome Cancer Prostate cancer Anemia Sickle-cell disease Hypoglycemia Sleep apnea Diabetes mellitus Folic acid Urinary incontinence Migraine First aid Psoriasis Pulse oximeter Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Group A streptococcal infection Malaria Medicine Hormone replacement therapy (trans) Atrial septal defect Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder Coeliac disease Stomach cancer Triage Atherosclerosis Gastroesophageal reflux disease Bipolar disorder Emphysema Lung cancer Carbon dioxide Shock Growth hormone treatment Hay fever Aortic dissection Lupus erythematosus Epilepsy Clinical depression Pulmonary embolism Anxiety Blood pressure AIDS Radiation therapy Common cold Coronary heart disease Anorexia nervosa Cirrhosis Autism Fire fighting Osteoporosis Crohn's disease Tobacco smoking AIDS reappraisal Post-traumatic stress disorder Eczema Osteoarthritis Psychosis Controversies in autism Pulmonary alveolus Sleep Androgen insensitivity syndrome Mesothelioma Tocopherol Traditional Chinese medicine Leukemia Sewage treatment Mastocytosis Haloalkane Cardiac arrest Schizophrenia Chlamydophila pneumoniae Legionellosis M__ni__re___s disease Turner syndrome Vitamin C Nutrition Chlorpromazine Rabies Propranolol
